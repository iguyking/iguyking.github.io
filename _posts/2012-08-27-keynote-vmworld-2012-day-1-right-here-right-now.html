<p style="text-align: left;">In the past I did live blogging and it was an interesting thing to do.&nbsp; Realistically it wasn't a great experience for those watching and for me writing it.&nbsp; Now a days, they are streaming live with VMware NOW and with near instant Twitter responses.&nbsp; Instead this is more for me to document and enjoy the event.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Stomp (like) starts off the event.&nbsp; Loud, exciting with drums in the VMworld at the center stage.&nbsp; Never to let down a good show, VMworld hit it off great.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rick Johnson, CMO start off with presentation around VMworld Agenda, General Session info and other scheduling stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuesday keynote will be covering the future of End User Computing by Scott Herrod.&nbsp; Then the battle royale among the Platinum Sponsors, live demo presentations with live voting of the event using mobile apps.&nbsp; The best live demo wins by individual votes.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">VMUG Rocks the house with some Green Shirts.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Paul Maritz now takes the stage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some interesting numbers on how the world has changed from 2008 to 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically his history on VMware.&nbsp; ~25k VCPs to ~125K, Workload Virtualization 25% to 60% of all loads.&nbsp; One of his great contributions is the Cloud direction.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the past 30 years, the primary driver of change is moving from Paper to Computer and that was considered innovative.&nbsp; This generation is more about streams of data and consumption of that data in different ways.&nbsp; It is about real-time versus specific static reporting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tying this data to how it impacts a person day to day is the mobile&#47;social link.<&#47;p><br />
One consistent direction for VMware coming from Paul is the 3 categories.&nbsp; Server to Cloud, Existing Apps to Apps &amp; Big Data and PC to Multiple End Points.&nbsp;&nbsp; These three categories are the same breakouts of Server Layer, Development Environment &amp; End User Computing as they have been for the past several years.</p>
<p>Paul at this point hands over Pat Gelsinger as the new CEO.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting note Pat stated is that Pat was the R&amp;D director and had a short meeting at an Intel Conference with Mendel from VMware.&nbsp;&nbsp; They held up the conference 10 mins as Mendel was telling Pat about VMotion.&nbsp; Mendel had it working and they were both so excited about use cases for this.</p>
<h2>Software Defined Decenter<&#47;h2><br />
Pat had said back in 2007 that VMware needed to setup the Virtual Datacenter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Significant progress has been made over the years.&nbsp; In order to do this the stacks and environment needs to be completely automated and virtualized.</p>
<p>vCloud Suite</p>
<p>This suite includes many of the pieces to get the Software Defined Datacenter.</p>
<ul>
<li>vCloud Director<&#47;li>
<li>SRM<&#47;li>
<li>vSphere<&#47;li>
<li>vCOPs<&#47;li>
<li>APIs<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Comprehensive, Highest Performance and Proven Reliability is the only way to put Mission Critical on something.&nbsp;&nbsp; vSphere 5.1 offers all this as the 9th major release.</p>
<p>vRAM is gone.&nbsp; Heard loud and hear and listen carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp; Going to a single CPU approach licensing model with no limits.&nbsp; Woot!.</p>
<p>Cloud OPs</p>
<p>So how do you keep all this stuff running and build it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Process for Operational Readiness<&#47;li>
<li>Role Based Certifications<&#47;li>
<li>Training expansions<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Multi-Cloud is the future and today.</p>
<p>VMware already covers the PaaS with Cloud Foundry.&nbsp; Now to handle Automation &amp; Orchestration layer they have added Dynamic Ops.&nbsp; Finally to add the bottom is at the Software Defined Datacenter layer is Nicira for Networking Virtualization.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally VMware joined the OpenStack organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have a strong spread to cover many of the layers.</p>
<h2>New Application Environment<&#47;h2><br />
vFabric and Cloud Foundry is going well.&nbsp; Nothing really to note as new here.&nbsp; Just continued development and movement forward.</p>
<p>End User Computing</p>
<p>Wanova&#47;Mirage to manage PCs both physical and virtual.&nbsp; Horizon is turning into the central portal for all application space access.&nbsp;&nbsp; More to come here.</p>
<p>Pat is very respectful over what Paul Mariz has given to VMware and the kind of visionary VMware needed.&nbsp; Both of these men have been revolutionary IT leaders over the past 30 years.</p>
<p>On to Scott Herrod's presentation.</p>
<p>One of the steps forward in the Server Virtualization space is moving from a single VM up to multiple VMs in a single Virtual Datacenter. To do this compute, storage, networking and management have to be included.</p>
<p>In the compute space in 2011 with vSphere 5, 32 CPUs and 1Million IOPS per host.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now with vSphere 5.1, 64 CPUs and 1 Million IOPS per VM.&nbsp; Yes that's right.. Per VM!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Serious improvements.</p>
<p>Epic Medical Systems is now offering their medical critical applications on x86 and will ONLY support it on vSphere.&nbsp; This is an amazing announcement.</p>
<p>Along with all of the advancements of vSphere to help low latency and jitter sensitive applications such as Telephony.</p>
<p>Hadoop got some time around Project Serengeti.&nbsp; This is a management application for Hadoop.</p>
<p>Software Defined Datacenter Storage</p>
<p>Interesting that Scott flew over the Storage VMotion that can be done with no shared storage.&nbsp; This is huge as this is a major marketing capability of Hyper-V 3.0.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of advancements and announcements here too.&nbsp; Virtual Volumes, Virtualizing Flash, Virtual SAN.. SDDC for Storage is changing this world pretty seriously.</p>
<p>Software Defined Datacenter Networking</p>
<p>Many of the issues that happen now is networking.&nbsp; To configure and setup Load Balancing, Network configurations can be significantly complex.&nbsp; How do we move this along?</p>
<p>vXLAN ecosystem is how Scott is talking about this.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are all sorts of different networking capabilities and I just can't keep up with this all.&nbsp; This space is moving fast from server offload to layer 3 edge interfaces to all sorts.&nbsp;&nbsp; It might finally to be time to make the VM that goes around the world.</p>
<p>After having all this great tech the next challenge is how to manage it.&nbsp; Going forward with the Suite's will have vCOPs for example and how to integrate it in.&nbsp;&nbsp; A good example is vCops shown directly in the vCloud interface.</p>
<p>Ultimately being able to expand this space is the partner enhancements.&nbsp; So being able to utilize the existing API suite (vCloud API) to not have to deal with permissions separately or structure.&nbsp; Just use the existing space.</p>
<p>The finish up is the cool demo on the ability to setup a VDC in a couple minutes between the private and public cloud. Sounds good.. just a big techie and quick with no time to sink in.</p>
<p>Slipped in quickly.. Enterprise+ gets a free upgrade to the vCloud Suite.</p>
<p>VMware is pushing the world forward.&nbsp; I haven't been this wowed since VMotion was first announced.</p>
