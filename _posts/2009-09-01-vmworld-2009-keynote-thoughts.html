  content: I was wondering if you ever thought of changing the layout of your website?
    Its very well written; I love what youve got to say. But maybe you could a little
    more in the way of content so people could connect with it better. Youve got an
    awful lot of text for only having 1 or two pictures. Maybe you could space it
    out better?

<p>Ok.. Its proven.&nbsp;&nbsp; No-one in the industry can keep up with Scott with blogging.&nbsp;&nbsp; You want a live blog go <a title="Keynote Live blog" href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.scottlowe.org&#47;2009&#47;09&#47;01&#47;vmworld-2009-day-1-keynote&#47;" target="_blank">here<&#47;a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cloud.&nbsp; Business Complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Give businesses Flexibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The great question is how do you do this?&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the point is "Simplify so things can happen since it is so complex today."&nbsp;&nbsp; People understand the current environments where application stacks exist on physical hardware instances and it works.&nbsp;&nbsp; Complex, though it works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cloud that VMware is proposing is a layer between this hard tie of Physical Hardware to the Application Stack.&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of this is not anything new to folks.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a straight up thought of API development.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take something that lot of different systems&#47;interfaces do and abstract it into an object with well defined interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By adding in this additional layer&nbsp;IT and business can simplify&nbsp;those interactions.&nbsp; This is an amazing and great&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;simplification that is being offered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not something to make light of if&nbsp;one has worked in a seriously large IT shop.&nbsp;&nbsp; VMware is the only company I've seen to date that has taken a serious analysis of these interfaces between the different technologies and domains involved in supplying services from IT to the business side.&nbsp;&nbsp; This covers all the various pieces of the VMware structure like vSecurity, vStorage, vNetwork, vCompute, vAvailability, vScalability and the other vStuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The individualized components that now have well defined (or at least a first run at it) of these interfaces.&nbsp; So the complexity can still exist inside of the box that is defined though others can deal with that component in a nice clean way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then too you can start producing some nice flexibility to do auto provisioning and self management.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you have this API you can control anything that talks to those interaction points.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why VMware is on the cutting edge and Microsoft &amp; Citrix are still behind.</p>
