<p>Most enterprises take security very seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp; As such it is extremely common to have a webproxy setup by default in your environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; PowerCLI&#47;Powershell are configured by default to Use System Proxy.&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that when you attempt to use some of the cmdlets they will end up being attempted to get routed through the proxy.</p>
<p>Two cmdlets that do not work properly when this is happening are <em>Install-VMHostPatch<&#47;em> &amp; <em>Copy-DatastoreItem<&#47;em>.  A good indication of the proxy being involved is exceptions that have items like:<br />
<code> Proxy Authentication Required<&#47;code></p>
<p>To work around this wrap the code in a <em>Set-PowerCLIConfiguration<&#47;em> proxy avoidance.  </p>
<pre lang="powershell" line="1">$CurrentProxyCfg = Get-PowerCLIConfiguration<br />
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -ProxyPolicy NoProxy<br />
...<br />
Install-VMHostPatch [...]<br />
...<br />
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -ProxyPolicy $CurrentProxyCfg.ProxyPolicy<br />
<&#47;pre></p>
<p>Thanks to @cshanklin & @lucd for their assistance in aiming me down the right path.  </p>
