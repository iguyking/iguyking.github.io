<p>On the 17th of Feb some form of Power Failure occurred at one of VMware's Palo Alto locations.&nbsp;&nbsp; From what I understand this primarily affected the support systems and as such the phones were down for most of the day.</p>
<p>Update 18 Feb 10 @ 8:28pm:</p>
<p>@vmwarecares Network outage here caused by small plane crash in Palo Alto</p>
<p>http:&#47;&#47;www.cnn.com&#47;2010&#47;US&#47;02&#47;18&#47;texas.plane.crash&#47;index.html?hpt=C1</p>
<p>VMware Support back and up and running by 9pm CST.</p>
