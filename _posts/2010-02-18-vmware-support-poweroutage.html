<p>On the 17th of Feb some form of Power Failure occurred at one of VMware's Palo Alto locations.   From what I understand this primarily affected the support systems and as such the phones were down for most of the day.</p>
<p>Update 18 Feb 10 @ 8:28pm:</p>
<p>@vmwarecares Network outage here caused by small plane crash in Palo Alto</p>

<p>VMware Support back and up and running by 9pm CST.</p>
