<p><a title="IBM SUN purchase" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.tomshardware.com&#47;news&#47;IBM-Sun-Acquisition,7462.html" target="_blank">Sun to be bought by IBM<&#47;a> for $7 billion. <a title="Rackable to buy SGI" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sgi.com&#47;company_info&#47;newsroom&#47;press_releases&#47;2009&#47;april&#47;rackable.html" target="_blank"> SGI bought by Rackable<&#47;a> for $25 million.</p>
<p>The SGI purchase I can understand as Rackable wants to be a one stop shop for their customers.&nbsp; SGI has been on a downward spiral for years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who needs to buy a super expensive custom OS&#47;Hardware to do graphics processing or HPC when I can get commodity hardware and do just as well if not better?</p>
<p>The Sun purchase doesn't make much sense to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; IBM has no need&#47;want for a new OS and it sure can't be for the sales force&#47;contacts that Sun has.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can think two things that it "might" want.&nbsp;&nbsp; One is to expand their server hardware line to AMD though why?&nbsp;&nbsp; IBM is well known for their "better than Intel" line of Intel x86 chips and Sun is of the same quality generation in AMD terms.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other thing I can think of is that IBM wants to take full control of the Java Stack.&nbsp; They have a heavy investment in WebSphere and is one of their more profitable product lines so why not take control all the way down if you can?</p>
