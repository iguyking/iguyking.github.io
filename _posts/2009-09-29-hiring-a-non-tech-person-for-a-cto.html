  content: ! "CTO, a non-technical person, huh!!!, wonder why his designation would
    still be called CTO,that's probably the first one I heard off in my 5 years in
    IT. Never seen a CTO being a non-techie.\n\nbut just read this last line \n\n\"For
    the ones that are wondering: Simon Crosby is still at his position as the CTO
    of the Virtualization & Management division\"\n\nso this pretty much explains
    that new CTO will be the guys who will speak where as Simon will be asked to focus
    more on product improvement rather than have him speak at conferences."

    You have to wonder how a non-technical CTO is going to do, and how that portion
    of the company is going to grow in a technical sense.  To me, a CTO needs to have
    the tech background, coupled with business sense.

    Good luck to Harry @ Citrix!

<p>Citrix has gone and <a title="Citrix's new CTO" href="http://www.virtualization.info/2009/07/citrix-hires-new-cto-for-application.html" target="_blank">hired a new CTO</a></p>
<p>For me I'm seeing another business person at Citrix in charge of the technical direction, not someone that has a strong basis of engineering and technology.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm judging MBA's harshly, though they are bred and trained to aim for sales and revenue.  Engineering backgrounds aim for better products and solutions.   There is nothing wrong with either and every software business needs both.   For me, it just tells you the focus Citrix has at the top.   It isn't about the tech, its about the sales first and foremost.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on a non-scientific or non-engineering based Chief Technical Officer?</p>
