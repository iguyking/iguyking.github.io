<p>I've had the AppSpeed demo setup and running in one of my clusters.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you get the demo temporary license, its for 16 cores worth.&nbsp;&nbsp; My smallest environment to test in is 160 cores deep.</p>
<p>I figured no issue, I'll just see what I get for a couple different apps to see how it works.&nbsp;&nbsp; That didn't work out so well either.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any actually interesting app is multi-tier which happens to bounce across multiple cores&#47;hosts in the environment.</p>
<p>So I haven't forgotten and I'm not ignoring the statement.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've put in a request for a temporary license of 160 cores worth and I'm waiting for that to come through.&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 weeks and waiting now.</p>
