<p>The morning video is pretty neat and a clean match to yesterday's video.&nbsp; Anyone get this video for replay?&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of playing with letters flying around and a good theme fitting with the "hello freedom" this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is mainly Steve Herrod's presentation.&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 major initatives -&nbsp;View, vCloud, vSphere.&nbsp;&nbsp; All driven around business need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>View has over 1,000,000 desktops and 7,000 customers today.&nbsp;&nbsp; The high focus is around better efficiency day to day.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is built over the vSphere system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over 3 million engineer hours put into vSphere.&nbsp;&nbsp; vSphere has some nice base to work on such as Commonality for management, Security, Availability, Efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Focusing on View some big points are Provisioning, Image Updating &amp; Policy Enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp; The key to desktops is breaking them apart into the same separation that has been done on server side.&nbsp;&nbsp; Separate out the Application Stacks from the OS and pulling out Data Store parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big news is the announcement on <a title="rtoVirtualProfiles Agreement with VMware" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vmware.com&#47;company&#47;news&#47;releases&#47;rto-vmworld09.html" target="_blank">rtoVirtualProfiles agreement<&#47;a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>More next post...</p>
