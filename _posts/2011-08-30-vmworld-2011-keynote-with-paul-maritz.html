<p>Live blog taken during the keynote.</p>
<p>The keynote started off with a beautiful Tron-3D stylized video talking about computing, virtualization, automation and ultimately the cloud.&nbsp; Your cloud.&nbsp; My cloud.</p>
<p>Hands on Labs started off as a private cloud onsite in 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp; It went to a hybrid cloud solution using some offsite datacenters in 2009.&nbsp; This year the labs are 100% public cloud in 3 datacenters in both US &amp; Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal is to handle 25,000 labs with over 250,000 VMs created and destroyed in less than 5 days. A truly scalable solution.</p>
<p>Another big point is the VMUG is over 60,000 strong across the entire world.&nbsp; Thanks to all leaders for the great work they do.</p>
<p>Paul Maritz's started off with some amazing information.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2009 was the first milestone where there is more virtual machines than physical machines.&nbsp;&nbsp; This year the milestone broken is that more than 50% of workloads are now running on virtuals.</p>
<p>Some amazing achivements with some number playing:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 VM every 6 seconds<&#47;li>
<li>20 million VMs<&#47;li>
<li>A VMotion every 5.5 seconds<&#47;li>
<li>800,000 vSphere Admins<&#47;li>
<li>68,000 VMware Certified Professionals<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
So what really is the cloud today?&nbsp; Is this something new or something recycled?</p>
<p>A quick history lesson.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">MainFrame<br />
Applications started as glorified bookkeeping for finance.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Client Server<br />
Relational Databases Started.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whole new set of applications<br />
New programing languages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Primarily PC users.&nbsp; Java, HTML, IP<br />
ERP, CRM, Non-Real-Time analytics possible.<&#47;p><br />
When the applications change, then the IT industry really changes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cloud<br />
In less than 3 years, the primary device connecting to the networks will be non-Windows OS instances. iPad, Droid, Etc.<br />
New Data Fabrics, new frameworks, HTML5,<br />
Real-time, high scale analytics and commerce - The Facebook generation<&#47;p><br />
A fundamental shift is IT needs to shift from supporting the client server era &amp; the mainframe era to renewing the applications into cloud frameworks and capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Spending in Client Server must become easier and cheaper.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime IT will bridge from existing modes of end-user access.</p>
<p>Server Virtualization is successful since we can add these functionality improvements without changing the apps.</p>
<p>vSphere 5.0 needs to just work.&nbsp;&nbsp; To accomplish this VMware QA is extensively done:</p>
<ul>
<li>>1 million engineering hours<&#47;li>
<li>>2 million QA hours<&#47;li>
<li>200 new features<&#47;li>
<li>2,000 partner certifications<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
By delivering this heavily QAed solution, less effort must be taken to keep the infrastructure up and running which in turn means less cost to the businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can spend the money on new features, new frameworks and redeveloped applications instead of back end support costs.</p>
<p>In the vCloud, Service Providers are creating powerful vertical clouds for their industries.&nbsp;&nbsp; New York Stock Exchange is a good example.&nbsp; High end solutions that are gaining large interest by many clients.&nbsp; On the smaller end, Small Business Solutions are coming as "datacenter in a box" with the Storage Virtual Appliance now.&nbsp; Another vertical cloud is the SMB space and one solution there is the VMware GO.&nbsp;&nbsp; SaaS solution to provide functionality for the small SMBs.</p>
<p>New programs are written by young programmers, not older ones (>35).&nbsp; They are developing new frameworks and tools to make things easier.&nbsp;&nbsp; As such tools like Spring in vFabric 5 with things like tc server, GemFire &amp; SQLFire, VMware aims to offer a full solution of ways to modernize applications along with creating a data fabrics.&nbsp; The newly announced tool is VMware Data Director to automatically provision and manage databases.&nbsp; The other third is the PaaS suite to deliver the new application.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cloud Foundry covers this space.&nbsp;&nbsp; It supports all sorts of frameworks and tools.</p>
<p>Moving up the stack for support of end user computing&#47;Existing PC usage.&nbsp;&nbsp; View 5.0 officially announced.&nbsp; Horizon is the other piece in this layer.&nbsp; Windows offered some great functionality to the end clients.&nbsp; Delivery of the applications is a huge piece of that functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Horizon offers a new way to deliver applications.&nbsp; How do you deliver this to a iPhone, Droid, iPad etc?</p>
<p>Paul believes that we are entering a post document world.</p>
