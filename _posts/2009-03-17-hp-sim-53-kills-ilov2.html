  content: I agree 100%. HP needs a reset button for iLO. I've had issues as well
    where iLO is locked and no way to fix it but to take down the OS. If anyone from
    HP is reading this, *please* get it in the enhancement request queue.

  content: ! "We have implemented HP SIM 5.3 for monitoring our HP hardware and we
    are facing unique problem which is supposed to be known bug from HP. Problem is
    HP SIM lose its connectivity with SQL database. IRTC forum also says that it is
    known issue. We are currently working with L3 to find out root cause. \nLet us
    know if you if you are aware of it.\n\nThanks,\nVikash"

<p>Recently at the request of our vendor (HP), I went and had HP Systems Insight Manager updated to 5.3 about 3 weeks.&nbsp; Now this isn't "bleeding edge" and so I didn't feel it was a big deal to jump up to it already.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well over the past 3 weeks I've been getting this new alert coming from our SIM system and I just figured "Oh.. something new" and didn't fret about it too much.</p>
<blockquote>
<p >Event Name: (SNMP) Remote Insight&#47; Integrated LightsOut Interface Error (9006)<&#47;p></p>
<p >URL: https:&#47;&#47;HPSIM:2381&#47;<&#47;p></p>
<p >Event originator: HPSIM<&#47;p></p>
<p >Event Severity: Major<&#47;p></p>
<p >Event received: 12-Mar-2009, 17:31:02<&#47;p></p>
<p >Event description: Remote Insight&#47; Integrated Lights-Out Interface Error.<span> <&#47;span>The host OS has detected an error in the Remote Insight&#47; Integrated Lights-Out interface.<span> <&#47;span>The firmware is not responding.<&#47;p><br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">As you can tell from my lazy comments, this became a pretty big deal as iLO was completely toasty on these boxes where SIM was generating this alert.&nbsp; I contacted HP and it was a pretty entertaining exchange.<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><em>HP Support: <&#47;em> Are you running HP SIM 5.3?<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><em>Me: <&#47;em>Yes<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><em>HP Support: <&#47;em>Do you have iLO version 1.60 or 1.61?<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><em>Me: <&#47;em>Beats me.&nbsp; The iLOs are not responding so I have zero way to tell.<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><em>HP Support: <&#47;em>I think I know your problem.<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><em>Me: <&#47;em> <Silence for a minute.>&nbsp; Well don't leave me hanging here.<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><em>HP Support:<&#47;em> I'm reading an email alert that came through while we were talking.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a <a title="HP SIM 5.3 HotFix" href="http:&#47;&#47;h18013.www1.hp.com&#47;products&#47;servers&#47;management&#47;hpsim&#47;dl_windows.html" target="_blank">hotfix for HP SIM 5.3<&#47;a> and a recommendation to go up to firmware 1.70 for the iLO.<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><em>Me: <&#47;em> Oh great.&nbsp; *sigh*<&#47;p><br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">So now I get to physically pull power cords to fix iLOs everywhere.&nbsp; (Yes this means an OS reboot too.)<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">* Hey HP.&nbsp; Put a button onto the servers to "reboot the iLO".<&#47;p></p>
