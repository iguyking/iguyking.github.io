<p>I got back from a 10 day vacation where I was completely disconnected from work.&nbsp; The work emails started getting downloaded and the initial filter went through them.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;itsjustanotherlayer.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;666-emails.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-565" title="666-emails" src="http:&#47;&#47;itsjustanotherlayer.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;666-emails.png" alt="666 emails in the inbox" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>I have 666 unread ones in my inbox.&nbsp; Maybe its time to think about another job.</p>
