<p>I got back from a 10 day vacation where I was completely disconnected from work.  The work emails started getting downloaded and the initial filter went through them.</p>
<p><a href="http://itsjustanotherlayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/666-emails.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-565" title="666-emails" src="/public/img/666-emails.png" alt="666 emails in the inbox" /></a></p>
<p>I have 666 unread ones in my inbox.  Maybe its time to think about another job.</p>
