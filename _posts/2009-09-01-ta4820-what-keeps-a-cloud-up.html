<p>Arrived at the session early and was easy to get in even though I hadn't registered.&nbsp;&nbsp; The CTO of Stratus Tech started and covered the basics for his presentation.&nbsp; Covering things like his history and what the cloud is.&nbsp; A pretty common "Cloud is whatever folks want" and 80% of IT management agrees that the cloud will be great.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He feels that SaaS&nbsp;will have a&nbsp;.com style consolidation any day now.</p>
<p>Much of&nbsp;the legacy technology architectures like Mainframe, client server and n-tier applications are not going&nbsp;away even though everyone claims they are dead.&nbsp;&nbsp; As such the cloud is just moving these legacy systems into a separately &nbsp;managed group.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not necessarily removing them from service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of his big points is that Availability is a bit concerning moving to the cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp; Application Platform, Vendor Trust, Mgmt&#47;Platform monitoring &amp; Billing are 4 major areas of concern to make sure you know and have defined in the contracts.&nbsp; Can you trust your business to these when the services are down?&nbsp; VMware offers some of these.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Stratus CTO's comments are that you need a cloud environment with Fault-tolerant hardware platforms, 24&#47;7 services for support, Culture of high focus on availability technologies, and 30 years of experience doing&nbsp;work&nbsp;like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; 99.999% hardware uptime accomplished by heavy investments into monitoring and operational simplicity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stratus provides and develops lockstep hardware technology to keep things running as they provide hardware tandem architectures.&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 of 10 banks, 10 of 13 pharma, 900 health agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is clock locked systems in sync.&nbsp;&nbsp; MasterCard &amp; Visa use this so things always work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100% of credit card transactions in Japan are run through their servers.&nbsp; They work on Windows, Linux and now VMware.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This kind of hardware takes you from Basic HA to Better Fault Tolerance to&nbsp;finally Continous Availability.&nbsp; The FAA has identified that Continous Availability is extremely critical.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are looking to upgrade from older versions of the hardware and Stratus's answer was to move to vSphere with Stratus's ftServer to get to 24 hour and near 100% uptime.</p>
<p>Virtualization works today for much of the functionality of "cloud"&nbsp; In the near term their will be Private Clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving to public clouds is still in the air and there is a lot of hype versus reality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Security and availability is a major concern for public clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What keeps clouds up?&nbsp;&nbsp; Products, Services, Experience &amp; People and Culture.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the whole picture and not just pieces and parts.&nbsp; What is the cost of downtime and is the possibilty of public downtime acceptable?&nbsp;&nbsp; Many pieces of technology are extremely difficult to deal with in this regard to validate uptime and keep your business working.</p>
