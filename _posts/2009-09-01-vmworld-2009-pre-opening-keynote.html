<p>Sitting here talking to some of the bloggers around the sphere and <a title="Scott Blowe's Blog" href="http://blog.scottlowe.org" target="_blank">Scott Lowe</a> and couple others had some good fun.   Just like the concept of VDI was driven by companies such as myself and others with a true business need.  We offer up the next great idea for VMware from the community.  </p>
