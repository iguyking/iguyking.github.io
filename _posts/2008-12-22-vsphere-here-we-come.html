<p>Ever since VMworld 2008 I've been waiting on the official words on what the new VI4 version name will be.   I figured it'd be changed from VMware VI4 which was the latest name.  Just wasn't sure what it would change to.</p>
<p>Du Du DAAHAHAAAAA</p>
<h2>VMware vSphere</h2><br />
This according to <a href="http://vmblog.com/archive/2008/12/19/vmware-vi4-nope-it-s-called-vmware-vsphere.aspx" target="_blank">vmblog.com</a></p>
<p>Makes sense.   Just curious when the official announcement will come.</p>
