<p>Eric Siebert, of vSphere-land.com fame, has published the <a title="Top 25 Blog List" href="http:&#47;&#47;vsphere-land.com&#47;news&#47;top-vmware-blogger-results.html" target="_blank">Top 25 blog<&#47;a> list of 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you look through the list there is some awesome bloggers out there.&nbsp; I take great pride in having met some of them at VMworld and VMUG events and look forward to more interactions with all these brilliant thinkers and communicators.</p>
<p>Congrats to all the excellent information sharers out there.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have all earned it.</p>
<p>On my side I am super ecstatic that I had 20 people vote for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you to all the readers of this blog.</p>
