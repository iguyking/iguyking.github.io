<p>VMworld 2010 is coming to a close.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has been a very different ride than previous VMworlds in my experience. &nbsp; &nbsp; So stay tuned for my wrap up.</p>
<p>This is a live blog posting.</p>
<p>Richard - Chief Marketing Officer</p>
<p>vTicket - The Golden Ticket - You will just have to wait and see what they win (must be present to win).</p>
<p>13,000 labs so far - over 150k VMs<br />
Ron Davis took all 30 labs first (yes.. took all 30 labs available)</p>
<p>Innovation:</p>
<p>#1 Doing something new<br />
Early on the Mainframe saw that they were severely under utilized and created virtualization.<br />
#2 Changing the way things are done<br />
VMware first started changing the way in 2001 in the datacenter</p>
<p>Update: 9:06am:</p>
<p>Discussion on the future of end user experience:</p>
<p>Pranav Mistry from the MIT Media Lab.&nbsp;&nbsp; Created Sixth Sense.</p>
<p>The question is when connecting devices (just a few) in a way to interact with the cloud (internet).<br />
He created an interface to interact with the objects inside the computer.&nbsp; What about using paper?&nbsp;&nbsp; What about working in spatial?</p>
<p>The next way is making ordinary objects be able to interact with the cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we make interaction with computers simpler?&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we really care about computers or do we care about the information instead?</p>
<p>If we take the information out of the computers we can tie that information to the real world objects.&nbsp;&nbsp; We take and project those pixels then we can start interacting with them outside the computer.&nbsp; Say you have an airplane ticket, if a camera can take the information in, why can't it then check if the flight is on time and then display that information onto the ticket with a little projector.</p>

<p>Update 9:25am:</p>
<p>Natan Linder - MIT Media Lab</p>
<p>Adding I&#47;O to the real world.&nbsp;&nbsp; What if anywhere we have a plug&#47;power we can interact with the Web?&nbsp;&nbsp; Project LuminAR.&nbsp; What if you plug a computer interface into a light socket that can respond to what your doing?&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring up a webpage&#47;youtube about the book your currently reading and project it onto the desk your sitting at.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tie that in with a robot that can help you out based on your guestures and environment needs.</p>
<p>Update 9:35am:</p>
<p>Tan Le - Emotiv Systems</p>
<p>Brain computing interface.&nbsp;&nbsp; All communication with computers is specific commands.&nbsp;&nbsp; With humans there are many more layers of communication from feelings, emotions, facial experssions, experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; What if we can bring those data points into the computer?</p>
<p>The issue with brain computing is everyone's brain works a little bit differently.&nbsp;&nbsp; Emotiv has developed an algorithm to help this mapping.&nbsp; The second issue is the physical interface to be able to get the signals from a human head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This headset is cost manageable now.</p>
<p>Steve Herrod, What a great sport getting up on stage and using the Emotiv Headset for a live demostration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Incredible technology.</p>
