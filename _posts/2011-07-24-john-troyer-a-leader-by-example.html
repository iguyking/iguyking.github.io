<p>One of the challenges any leader has is how to motivate and encourage people to contribute their time and energy to a cause. This can be done a variety of ways and a company that wants to foster a community needs someone that can use all of them.&nbsp; Often a community forum is setup early on to help create a hangout location for their customers to share successes.&nbsp;&nbsp; These forums will start out strong and then peter out after a short period of time.&nbsp; The initial contributors don't feel thanked for their work, get discouraged and leave.&nbsp; People stop coming to the forums since their questions don't get answered and its a vicious cycle.&nbsp; VMware's community has managed to avoid this downward trend and is the strongest I've ever seen.</p>
<p>John Troyer is one of the great leaders at VMware who has helped foster the vExpert community and kept it alive and well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He encourages, thanks and helps supply these Experts with the recognition that a strong community needs.&nbsp; A ground breaker who connects with the community through podcasts, Twitter, forums and emails showing that our work is not ignored. &nbsp; He is out there responding to questions, posting challenges to start a new meme on Twitter and podcasting about the topics on people's minds constantly.&nbsp; He helps show that our efforts are one of the things that makes VMware stronger day by day.&nbsp; He brings to light that VMware appreciates our work and ultimately appreciates us.</p>
<p>Thanks John for the tons of work you do day to day helping connect with the VMware evangelists and die-hards.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for all the work you've done to make the vExpert program reward those that spend their free time making VMware better for everyone.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
