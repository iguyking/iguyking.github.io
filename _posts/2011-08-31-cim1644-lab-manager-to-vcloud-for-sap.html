<p>We know that Lab Manager is End of Life.&nbsp; It is just a matter of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; vCloud Director has most of the features and functionality to start migrating over.</p>
<p>Some of the nice new benefits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything in vCloud Director is full vSphere standard approach.&nbsp; No more missing data in vCenter like Lab Manager.<&#47;li>
<li>VMs&#47;vApps can be exported out as OVF and sent somewhere to start working immediately in a different environment.<&#47;li>
<li>No more SSMOVE needed.. just use Storage VMotion.<&#47;li>
<li>No more lab manager tools.&nbsp; Straight up VMware Tools and using APIs instead.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Some issues and limitations on Lab Manager of no more than 8 nodes per cluster.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some limits to vCloud Director.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure to take those limits into account.</p>
<p>Overall this session really covered much of the very high level view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
