<p>We know that Lab Manager is End of Life.  It is just a matter of time.   vCloud Director has most of the features and functionality to start migrating over.</p>
<p>Some of the nice new benefits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything in vCloud Director is full vSphere standard approach.  No more missing data in vCenter like Lab Manager.</li>
<li>VMs/vApps can be exported out as OVF and sent somewhere to start working immediately in a different environment.</li>
<li>No more SSMOVE needed.. just use Storage VMotion.</li>
<li>No more lab manager tools.  Straight up VMware Tools and using APIs instead.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Some issues and limitations on Lab Manager of no more than 8 nodes per cluster.   There are some limits to vCloud Director.   Be sure to take those limits into account.</p>
<p>Overall this session really covered much of the very high level view.</p>
