<p>Hanging out checking out some information on Exchange and decided to hit this session.&nbsp;&nbsp; My company is looking at upgrading and since we are going to Exchange 2010, I'd like to get us virtual on vSphere if we can make it happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex Fontana, our presenter, is a Microsoft Technical Specialist for VMware.</p>
<p>The trend has been clients have been pushing to virtualize Tier-1 apps such Exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp; At VMworld 2007, Dell had a Exchange 2003 performance study.&nbsp;&nbsp; VMworld 2008 introduced the SVVP program along with Exchange 2007 performance white papers.&nbsp; Along with the early adopters pushing the envelope, Exchange has improved its approach to disk access every release.&nbsp;&nbsp; It requires less and less IOPS in each release and still provide acceptable performance.</p>
<p>Over the years ESX has been improving and offering less overhead versus native performance in every release.&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting with ESX 2 which had anywhere from a possible 30-60% overhead costs to now ESX 4 which is <7% . This along with better hardware generations every 18 months has given even more performance.</p>
<p>This is backed by some performance tests done.&nbsp;&nbsp; In general the virtual has been within 5% of the the physical in a scale up test.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a private vSphere Cloud spread across the US, when using DRS, have seen about an overall 18% improvement in system performance versus not enabling DRS on the cluster with Exchange in it.</p>
<p>Some of the best practices mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go with a basic 1-1 ratio of vCPUs to pCPUs to start with.&nbsp; Scale out after monitoring to make sure performance is acceptable.&nbsp; Basically don't go with over subscription if possible.<&#47;li>
<li>Don't over&nbsp; commit memory until steady state is stable and available RAM<&#47;li>
<li>Spread the heavy I&#47;O systems across several LUNs<&#47;li>
<li>Use eagerthickzero VMDK files (Option at time of creation, select enable for FT in vSphere 4.x GUI)<&#47;li>
<li>RDMs are not any better than VMFS.&nbsp;&nbsp; VMFS can't do quorums though.&nbsp; Performance of VMFS is typically a little bit faster.<&#47;li>
<li>Use VMXnet3 driver - highly optimized performance in both lower CPU and TOE<&#47;li>
<li>Note:&nbsp; VMware does support VMotion&#47;DRS for Microsoft Cluster Nodes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cold migration does work fine though.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Exchange has a variety of requirements matrixes for which Exchange 2010 server role is needed.&nbsp; As long as the requriements matrix is followed for each role, the VMs should be scaled properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that requirements is a discussion around Megacycles.&nbsp;&nbsp; Need to generate that to scale properly.&nbsp; Some key notes is that Mailbox roles shouldnt' go above 70% utilization.&nbsp;&nbsp; The recommendation is to use the Exchange 2010 Mailbox Server Role Requirements Calculator.&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially around the database availability groups (DAG) going on.</p>
<p>As you design your Exchange 2010 need to keep in account the limitations of vSphere Configuration Maximums.&nbsp;&nbsp; One additional one is keep the DAG under 1TB a piece to say under the 2TB limits of each VMFS volume.&nbsp; Along with that be sure to take into account passive databases in DAG setups.</p>
<p>There is a large set of good slides to cover various VMware products and how they work with Microsoft clustering and DAGs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Things like SRM functionality and vMotion and HA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitely more details in the slides than I will cover here.</p>
<p>Exchange 2010 is nicely VSS friendly and as such can take array based backups quickly and painlessly offline.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can easily have a 10 second backup window where we have impact on the Exchange systems.</p>
<p>At the end of the day we need to define what level of availability do we need?&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the SLAs?&nbsp;&nbsp; What level of corruption do we need to be concerned about?&nbsp;&nbsp; Can recovery be manual or does this need to be automated and why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we use VMware features or do we need to use the Exchange features?</p>
