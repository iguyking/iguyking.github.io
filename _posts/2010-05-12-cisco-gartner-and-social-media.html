  content: ! 'Thanks, Ian.  I think what people forget is that the ViewYonder blog
    is not representative of my complete thoughts and actions: it is, instead, a great
    way to engage people in discussion about topics I find interesting.


    That means sometimes a post is not 100% what I believe in and instead is a way
    to engage people.  I''ve done this with HP guys, Scott Lowe, etc.


    I''m actually a big fan of many HP staff, and a really big fan of Scott, so when
    I''m tweaking their nipplets it''s really a playful tweak in the hope they tweak
    me back and we all have a good laugh about it.


    You''re right about one thing, though: Cisco have been very good here and I''m
    glad I work for them.  I''m not sure other organisations would have been so supportive.


    Take care, mate

    Steve'

<p>ViewYonder.com went <a title="Silence" href="http:&#47;&#47;viewyonder.com&#47;silence&#47;" target="_blank">off the air<&#47;a> for a short period of time yesterday due to comments made about a Gartner report.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gartner apparently pushed Cisco to have Steve Chambers pull a posting that he made about a report by one of the analysts.&nbsp; You can read <a title="ViewYonder.com" href="http:&#47;&#47;webcache.googleusercontent.com&#47;search?q=cache:lJUWxuriHTYJ:viewyonder.com&#47;2010&#47;03&#47;25&#47;chicken-little-in-the-unified-data-center-starring-joe-skorupa-of-gartner&#47;+view+yonder+fcoe+post&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a" target="_blank">his report<&#47;a> via various caching engines and there is a couple of good websites that have re-posted the post basically <a title="PlanetVM" href="http:&#47;&#47;planetvm.net&#47;blog&#47;?p=1521&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+planetvm%2FjeAy+%28PlanetVM%29" target="_blank">word<&#47;a> for <a title="LoneSysadmin" href="http:&#47;&#47;lonesysadmin.net&#47;2010&#47;05&#47;11&#47;cisco-gartner-censoring-viewyonder&#47;" target="_blank">word<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>I don't normally agree with Steve's viewpoints or his ideas or his general tone.&nbsp;&nbsp; The right for him to post his thoughts is important as getting bullied affects all of us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We as bloggers and independent thinkers do have a right to talk about things that are not company confidential or business sensitive information.&nbsp; There is quite an outpouring of support from the Web &amp; Twitter for Stevie.</p>
<p>Thankfully <a title="Social Media Policy" href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.cisco.com&#47;news&#47;comments&#47;ciscos_internet_postings_policy&#47;" target="_blank">Cisco's very supportive Social Media policy<&#47;a> did come into play here and since Steve only mostly insulted the intelligence of the Gartner analyst, a fairly easy target, he has come back online.&nbsp; His managers and other's in Cisco's corporate office have been supportive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thankfully Cisco does have some good people there.</p>
<p>So Steve, When are you putting that post back up?</p>
