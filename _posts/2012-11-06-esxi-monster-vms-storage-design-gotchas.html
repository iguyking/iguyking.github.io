<p>Jason Boche posted an <a title="ESXi Heap Size" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.boche.net&#47;blog&#47;index.php&#47;2012&#47;09&#47;12&#47;monster-vms-esxi-heap-size-trouble-in-storage-paradise&#47;">interesting discovery<&#47;a> with regards to Monster VMs and the amount of storage one would be sticking to them. &nbsp;One of the large projects being designed today &nbsp;has the likely reason to hit this limit with just a single VM. &nbsp;This is pretty easy for that project to hit that as a single VM will have about 75TB assigned to it. &nbsp; Since this design has 4 or 5 VMs of this size, which then means our standard ESXi Host will have around 300+ TB assigned to it. &nbsp;Thankfully RDM isn't impacted by this limit in theory, so there is a workaround available. &nbsp;Not ideal and yet doable.</p>
<p>Instead one of the questions that came out of this news is "Does this issue impact the rest of our environment?" &nbsp; Will this explain some random&nbsp;stability&nbsp;issues we have seen?</p>
<p>This script will return what every single host has in terms of VMDK files. &nbsp;To use this script look at each host and see if the host itself is under the limits. &nbsp;Then look at the cluster level based on the HA rules and see what the VMDK limits would be if a host failed. &nbsp;That should give an idea of how close your clusters might be to hitting this limit.</p>
