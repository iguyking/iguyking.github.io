<p>I've been watching things finally quiet down from VMworld 2009 and have some of the trends and summaries I have seen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the trends are interesting, some not so much.</p>
<p><strong> Twitter<&#47;strong><br />
Twitter really started the first time last year with following @vmworld.&nbsp;&nbsp; This year the # was all the rage.&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as you followed #vmworld you could see everything folks were talking about.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two good # that were fun this time around were</p>
<ul>
<li>The #vCloud&nbsp;- Take a Drink game.<&#47;li>
<li> #VMworld3Word - 3 words for folks at VMworld.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I full expect this to only grow next year.</p>
<p><strong> The Virtual Datacenters @ VMworld<&#47;strong><br />
Pretty impressive seeing the big one riding down the main escalator at the Moscone Center.&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch as they <a title="Building the vDC for VMworld 2009" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=aOnNpBkRam0" target="_blank">build it<&#47;a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>776 VMware ESX Servers, 37 Terabyte internal RAM Memory, 6208 Cores and 348 TB of Shared Storage.&nbsp; Wow. &nbsp; Then the talks were how performance wasn't there initially as the various engineers worked hard at resolving it. &nbsp; Things were running good by Tuesday Night&#47;Wednesday morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; The one thing that many of us talked about was how the big data center just looked lopsided.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was 3 server style racks to each Storage style rack.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ratio just looked odd to most of us. <&#47;span></p>
<p><span>Next year I full expect to see one single big data center instead of having small, medium and large ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm still hoping to get some answers from folks from my<a title="So how'd the datacenter do?" href="http:&#47;&#47;itsjustanotherlayer.com&#47;2009&#47;08&#47;vmworld-is-run-on-a-killer-esx-clusters-so-howd-it-go&#47;" target="_blank"> initial blog entry<&#47;a>.<br />
<&#47;span></p>
<p><strong>Booth Babes<&#47;strong><br />
A lot more booth babes this year.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not terribly excited about this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure the eye candy is nice.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to talk with engineers, developers, product managers after wading my way through some marketing folks.&nbsp;&nbsp; In general if a show is all about the Marketing&#47;Booth Babes (and Guys) then the vendor floor has next to no value for me.</p>
<p><strong>Keynote Lukewarm<&#47;strong><br />
Both Keynotes this year didn't seem to really talk about all the cool stuff coming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not sure if this is a new leadership approach or just not much going on this year with the financial slowdown or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; vCloudExpress stuff was nice though I expected to see more "You Gotta Check out the PCoIP stuff we are doing" and "This is mega cool".</p>
<p><strong>Vendor &#47; ISV issues<&#47;strong><br />
Lots of chats were around the general feeling of hostility coming from VMware to ISV discussions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some talk about the rules limiting what Citrix&#47;Microsoft  could do and be demoing and shown at the conference.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Most of the talk was they deserved it for the stuff pulled last year.&nbsp; Some was a let down that we couldn't see what they were doing.)&nbsp; Some of the talk was interactions with ESXi and what was&#47;wasn't allowed to compete with VMware's own offerings.&nbsp; The quote that I heard that best describes it was "<em>Is VMware turning into the Microsoft machine now?<&#47;em>"</p>
<p><strong>Less Swag, Less People<&#47;strong><br />
My guess is the aim was 15k+ people and about 13k came versus last years 14k limit at Vegas.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was less swag which wasn't surprising since the financial changes in the past year.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone<&#47;strong><br />
I have never seen more iPhones in a single place than in San Fran which was easily 1 in 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then when I went into the Moscone Center for VMworld it was easily 1 in 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Crazy nuts what people were doing with their iPhones.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was introduced to a good 4 dozen apps that I've never heard of and now have a good solid set of reasons to get an iPhone.</p>
<p>The other fun was the discussion around the iPhones as a conversation starter of "How many bars do you have?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on the day and time you'd have anywhere from 0 to 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lucky person was one that could actually hold a phone conversation while in&#47;near the Moscone Center with their iPhone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service from AT&amp;T was less than ideal .</p>
<p><strong>Better Bag<&#47;strong><br />
The VMworld given bag went back to the style of a true backpack instead of the messenger style.&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally I like this as my VMworld 2006 with the same style is starting to get a little well used by now.</p>
<p><strong>Live Blogging<&#47;strong><br />
This is a skill I am not sure I have though I've learned quite a bit by watching, reading and learning how to properly live blog.&nbsp; If I look to do this again next year I will need to do some reading on different successful ways to do this kind of blogging.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried 2 different methods with varying success in my book.&nbsp;&nbsp; For those of you that read through some of my Keynote Live Blogging posts.. I do apologize and promise to do better.</p>
<p>Overall a good conference again for the time spent with some quality people from VMware, NetApp, Cisco, HP, newScale and all the other individuals I talked with.&nbsp;&nbsp; I look forward to next year.&nbsp;&nbsp; See you all there.</p>
