    My 5 host production cluster is at 572 vMotions. :)'

  content: Thank you for all your nice articles.Now I have a qusioetn about the performance
    of vCenter Server.Will vCenter Server be the bottleneck?1) vCenter Server obtains
    the realtime resource usage information of every VM. And the powered on VM can
    reach 10000 in a vCenter Server.2) I have thought that for every DRS cluster there
    will be a DRS module. The DRS module is responsible for the VM placement and load
    balance. What's more, the DRS module and vCenter Server lie on different hosts.
    But my thought might be wrong. the DRS modules of all the clusters and vCenter
    Server lie on the same module.I could not imagine how could vCenter Server on
    a single host could handle so many requests And will vCenter Server be the bottleneck?Thank
    you.

  content: ! "I think what you said made a lot of sense. However, consider this, what
    if you were to create a awesome headline?\r\nI ain't saying your information isn't
    good., \r\nbut suppose you added a title that makes people want more?\r\nI mean
    100k vMotions in Production | Its Just Another Layer \r\nis kinda boring. You
    might look at Yahoo's home page and watch \r\nhow they create post titles to grab
    viewers interested.\r\n\r\nYou might add a video or a related pic or two to grab
    readers \r\nexcited about what you've written. Just my opinion, it could bring
    your blog \r\na little bit more interesting."

  content: ! "I was curious if you ever considered changing the layout of your site?\r\n\r\nIts
    very well written; I love what youve \r\ngot to say. But maybe you could a little
    more in the way of content so \r\npeople could connect with it better. Youve got
    an awful lot of text for \r\nonly having one or 2 pictures. Maybe you could space
    it out \r\nbetter?"

<p>I logged into the environment and was checking some things out and we just recently broke a rather important milestone.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;itsjustanotherlayer.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;100k-vMotions.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-571" title="100k-vMotions" src="http:&#47;&#47;itsjustanotherlayer.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;100k-vMotions.png" alt="" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>In our production environment one of our oldest clusters just broke 100,000 vMotions (or more accurately since they aren't at ESXi 4.1U1 yet, VMotions).</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;itsjustanotherlayer.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;100k-vMotionSummary.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-572" title="100k-vMotionSummary" src="http:&#47;&#47;itsjustanotherlayer.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;100k-vMotionSummary.png" alt="100k vMotion Summary" &#47;><&#47;a> This cluster has weathered the ups and downs of a functional vSphere cluster with hosts going into an out of Maintenance Mode, Hardware failures and general maintenance.&nbsp; This cluster we had over allocated on CPU for a couple months per our standard policy, though we got no real complaints about performance there.&nbsp; We have since updated that policy and I'm sure the number of vMotions has slowed down somewhat.</p>
<p>Just proof that vMotions&#47;DRS &amp; the entire vSphere solution is valid and solid.&nbsp; Here's to another 100k vMotions.</p>
