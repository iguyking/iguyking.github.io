  content: Ian, that all being said.  If you are fine with 40 or less VMs per host,
    there is nothing wrong with a larger cluster is there?   Generally, I see 8 or
    less more for storage limitations (# of LUNs) than for arbitrary software limitations
    of VMware.

  content: ! 'To my knowledge and testing you should be fine going above an 8 host
    cluster if you don''t mind having 40 or less VMs per host average.   It is all
    around HA working.   I haven''t had an issue with the # of LUNs per cluster (256
    max) causing an issue yet.   I have a couple clusters currently with 10 hosts
    and around 400 VMs in the cluster and about 25 or so LUNs.   So for me to hit
    the 256 I''m going to have to really pack in the VMs since there is a 32 Host
    Cluster limit at this time too.'

<p>For a large organization that has more than 8 VMware Hosts (nodes) one should only make 8 node clusters for the time being according to the vSphere 4 Config Max doc.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vmware.com&#47;pdf&#47;vsphere4&#47;r40&#47;vsp_40_config_max.pdf">http:&#47;&#47;www.vmware.com&#47;pdf&#47;vsphere4&#47;r40&#47;vsp_40_config_max.pdf<&#47;a></p>
<p>If you look on page 7 it says "<em>Configurations exceeding 40 VMs per host are limited to cluster size no greater than 8 nodes<&#47;em>".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What that means is to be supported you have the following chart:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">8 Nodes&nbsp;&nbsp;x 100 VMs &#47; Node&nbsp;&nbsp;== 800 VMs per cluster max<&#47;p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">9 Nodes x 40 VMs &#47; Node&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;== 360 VMs per cluster max<&#47;p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">20 Nodes x 40 VMs&#47; Node&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; == 800 VMs per cluster max<&#47;p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">32 Nodes x 40 VMs &#47; Node&nbsp;&nbsp; == 1,280 VMs per clustre max<&#47;p></p>
<p>Now I might not be too smart here some days though I think the math is pretty obvious.&nbsp; Either I do 4 clusters of 8 nodes to give me 3,200 VMs on 32 boxes or I stick them all into one nice big cluster and get 1,280 VMs out of those 32 boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Easy math to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question I have out of this is, why do you document it this way?&nbsp; That sure is confusing and I could have easily missed that.</p>
