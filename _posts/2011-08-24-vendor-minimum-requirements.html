<p>Recently I was pulled into a slow performance issue with a VM. After looking at the standard metrics of value and seeing that none of them were really bad, I started asking some more questions.&nbsp; We contacted the vendor and they asked a bunch of questions back.&nbsp; Of course we responded being very transparent and the vendor came back and said your performance problem is due to the fact that your CPUs aren't 3.0Ghz or better.&nbsp; Now since we use AMD, this doesn't surprise me though none of our testing matched up to the claims the vendor made around 30% increase by using this new functionality.&nbsp; Our numbers say zero change in performance.&nbsp; So I pushed back and started reading on the requirements and this is what they list.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is great to say and is a wonderful cop out by the support team.</p>
<p><em>"Oh wait, you don't have a 3.0Ghz box"<&#47;em><br />
<em>"Ok, what model?"<br />
"Doesn't matter, must be 3.0Ghz or faster"<br />
"Alright, so will my 3.0Ghz Pentium 4 that's 5+ years old be fast enough?"<&#47;em></p>
<p>Try again vendor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be accurate and precise with your data and information at time of document creation with the expectation to deliver the right information to deliver a functional, quality product.<em><br />
