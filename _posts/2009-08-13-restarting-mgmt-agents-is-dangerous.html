<p>Once again I'm reminded that going in and doing <em><strong>/etc/init.d/mgmt-vmware restart</strong></em> and then <em><strong>/etc/init.d/vmware-vpxa restart</strong></em> is fairly dangerous and should only be done as a LAST resort.</p>
<p>A co-worker was removing old NFS mounts and replacing them with new ones.   So same named NFS mount was being used.   He did an <em><strong>esxcfg-nas -d</strong></em> and then an <em><strong>esxcfg-nas -a</strong></em> and per our instructions, restart the mgmt agents so VirtualCenter would see them properly.   In doing this with U4 plus a month of patches, VirtualCenter lost connectivity with the host agent with a vim.fault.NotAuthenticated.</p>

<p>The fix is to disconnect and reconnect as you can't put these systems into Maintenance Mode since VMotion doesn't work.    Together we figured out a nicer way to do the mount point cleanup.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>esxcfg-nas -d <mountpoint></em></li>
<li><em>esxcfg-nas -a <mountpoint> ...</em></li>
<li><em>vimsh -n -e "internalsvc/refresh_datastores"</em></li>
<li><em>vimsh -n -e "hostsvc/datastore/refresh <mountpoint>"</em></li><br />
</ul></p>
