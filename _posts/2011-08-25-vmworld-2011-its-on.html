<p>After much work and challenge, I have been able to get a VMworld Pass, a Plane Ticket and by the generosity of some wonderful VMware Peeps, a room to crash in.&nbsp; At this point I'm digging into and attempting to find sessions that I'd like to try to go to and getting packed to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; The late entry obviously will make getting into some of these great sessions nearly impossible, and I'll just have to make due.</p>
<p>After it's all said and done, this trip will still be worth it all.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing all the vExperts, Wizards, Stalkers and vEverything folks that I've met and look forward to meeting new ones.&nbsp; See you there.</p>
