<p>Exchange 2010 can be virtualized and this session covers how they did it.</p>
<p>Some of the design points that need to be covered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>DAS vs SAN<&#47;li>
<li>Scale up or Scale out<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
The choices made here are arbitrary and dependent on how you manage your datacenter and what you like&#47;don't like.</p>
<p>Their layout is:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 datacenters, 2 DCs in US &amp; 2 in Europe<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<ul>
<li>If they have a DC failure, can run around 25% reduced capacity<&#47;li>
<li>3 Hosts per datacenter<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<ul>
<li>2 Hosts are active, 1 failover<&#47;li>
<li>SAN backend with 1TB 7k rpm SATA disks<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
How did they do it?</p>
<ol>
<li>Virtuals are manually balanced across the hosts per role<&#47;li>
<li>DRS set to level 1 - don't VMotion naturally<&#47;li>
<li>No Reservations<&#47;li>
<li>Dedicated Farm versus using the general farm<&#47;li>
<ul>
<li>Exchange, all roles, all support systems etc<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;ol><br />
The Exchange 2010 Role layout is defined per OS instance, minimal sharing here.</p>
<p><strong>CAS Role<&#47;strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 G, 2 vCPUs<&#47;li>
<li>VMDK based<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<strong>Hub Role<&#47;strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4G , 4 vCPUs<&#47;li>
<li>VMDK based<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
MBX Role</p>
<ul>
<li>2000 mailboxes per server<&#47;li>
<li>6 vCPU<&#47;li>
<li>36G of RAM<&#47;li>
<li>3 NIC (MAPI, Backup &amp; Replication)<&#47;li>
<li>VMDK for OS &amp; Pagefile<&#47;li>
<li>RDM for Log &amp; DB disks<&#47;li>
<li>For the 1TB LUN sizes use the 8MB block size format<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
SAN configuration</p>
<ul>
<li>EMC Clarion CX4, 1TB 7200rpm SAT disk<&#47;li>
<li>RAID 6<&#47;li>
<li>Datastores in 8MB<&#47;li>
<li>Presented as 500GB and 1TB<&#47;li>
<li>OS, Pagefiles, &amp; Misc Storage are VMDK<&#47;li>
<li>Logfile &amp; Databases are RDM<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
LoadGen Physical versus Virtual</p>
<p>They ran some testing with VMware Assistance and the performance numbers were significantly under where Microsoft states are required.&nbsp; In most cases significantly under.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned:</p>
<p>Backups and disk contention as things grew did start to become an issue as load was added.&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms would be dropped connections.&nbsp; Moved the backups to the passive copies instead.&nbsp; This addressed much of the concerns.</p>
<p>When doing the migrations, take breaks in between each batch of migrations to iron out any issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; Found problems like pocket of users had unique issues and needed to have time to iron out the gotchas.</p>
<p>Database sizes introduce issues around backup, replication etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure you can manage them for the demands for your environment.</p>
<p>Some interesting discussions is that Hyper-Threading is not supported for production.&nbsp;&nbsp; It complicates performance discussions by Microsoft.&nbsp; VMware can do either so be sure to follow the Microsoft standards at the VM level.</p>
<p>Memory is a big question.&nbsp; Basically set</p>
<p>Storage.. the main points are make sure you have appropriate IOP capability behind the scenes.&nbsp; The other is if setting up VMDK files, should eagerZeroThick the VMDKs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you check the box for enabling FT during creatio, this will eagerZeroThick is automatically.&nbsp; Otherwise this should be done when the machine is powered off and run VMKFSTOOLS from the command line.</p>
<p>16 months later...</p>
<ul>
<li>Success doing VMotions and DAG failovers<&#47;li>
<li>Backups are running lights out<&#47;li>
<li>Will add more hosts to expand the environment<&#47;li>
<li>Pain Points:<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul>
<ul>
<li>Service Desk new process adoptions<&#47;li>
<li>Integration with legacy tools in house.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>After all is said and done this has done quite a bit for the company.</p>
<ol>
<li>Datacenter savings<&#47;li>
<li>TCO is down and has been passed on to the business<&#47;li>
<li>much greater flexibility<&#47;li>
<li>Scale out or Scale up very quickly<&#47;li>
<li>Lower Administrative overhead so far<&#47;li>
<li>More options for disaster recovery and scenarios<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol><br />
Exchange 2010 is possible.</p>
