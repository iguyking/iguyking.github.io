<p>Now this is what I expect from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/01/16/ST2009011603928.html" target="_blank">quality journalism sources</a>.</p>
<p>For a short while I thought that Congress was going to do something good in the name of Capitialism instead of turning America into a socialist or merchantlist state.    They were going to vote down the additional $350 billion of the Fall '08 Bail-Out package and Obama threatened/politicio them to pass it.</p>
<p>More evidence that the bail-out is wasted money for poorly lead big business whom need to fail for all our benefit.    Poor managment isn't making one bad choice, it is making lots.</p>
