<p>Now this is what I expect from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.washingtonpost.com&#47;wp-dyn&#47;content&#47;story&#47;2009&#47;01&#47;16&#47;ST2009011603928.html" target="_blank">quality journalism sources<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>For a short while I thought that Congress was going to do something good in the name of Capitialism instead of turning America into a socialist or merchantlist state.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were going to vote down the additional $350 billion of the Fall '08 Bail-Out package and Obama threatened&#47;politicio them to pass it.</p>
<p>More evidence that the bail-out is wasted money for poorly lead big business whom need to fail for all our benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor managment isn't making one bad choice, it is making lots.</p>
