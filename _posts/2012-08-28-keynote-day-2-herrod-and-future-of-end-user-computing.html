<p>Today's Keynote is all about the End User Computing experience and the Battle of the Platinum partners.</p>
<p>Branch in a box through the View Rapid Deployment Program.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take an appliance, some configuration and deploy as many workstations as you need.</p>
<p>Mirage from Wanova is being presented as the future of secured solutions and centralized management.&nbsp; ACE, Local Mode are great solutions for a limited set of end use cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mirage is aimed at handling all the various other end devices out there.&nbsp; It will offer disaster recovery and centralized management.</p>
<p>After an entertaining canned demo around Mirage.&nbsp; They presented some more advanced demos of using Tablets and existing OS instances.&nbsp;&nbsp; Project AppShift is some R&amp;D making it more swipe style based interface for Windows 7.&nbsp; This is User Interface Virtualization Techinques.&nbsp; This took takes several of Windows basic interface experiences and made them Tablet friendly with swiping and copy&#47;paste across the system.</p>
<p>Horizon Suite Administration is announced today and a quick demo.&nbsp; One of the points is that Horizon can manage Xen App Applications.&nbsp; Horizon Mobile on iOS will wrap applications into a secured workspace.&nbsp;&nbsp; This separates applications and control around security policies.&nbsp; So now it allows you to manage end devices cleanly and safely across multiple devices from a single interface tool.</p>
<p>VMworld Challenge -What is the things that Partners are doing to improve the VM space.&nbsp; They get 4 minutes to give their presentation.&nbsp; Then everyone at VMworld will vote using the mobile app on who gave the best preso (or is doing the most interesting thing).&nbsp; The winner will have their charity get a sizeable donation from VMware.</p>
<p>What are partners doing</p>
<p>Cisco - Playing for Kaboom who help build playgrounds in dense city centers for kids.</p>
<p>Techwise TV is presented by Cisco to making Networking more close.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gist of L.I.S.P.&nbsp; An interestingly cute little preso around VM Mobility with all the different means to move VMs around between datacenters due to IPv4&#47;IPv6.&nbsp; LISP is a free technology to use from Cisco.</p>
<p>Dell - playing for Girl Scouts of America.</p>
<p>Dell vStart 1000 is a stack that gives you the full Dell solution from storage, networking and compute in a rack with a simple management interface.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fully integrated</p>
<p>EMC - charity is Wounded Warriors</p>
<p>EMC believes that more things should be built in or easily available&nbsp; Directly from the Web Client, Chad Sakac from EMC, he created a backup job directly in vSphere environment.&nbsp; His demo is live as he does things and clicks it isn't pre-recorded. Chad ran out of time.&nbsp; He was the first and brave.</p>
<p>HP - playing for Big Brothers and Big Sisters</p>
<p>HP showed how they have integrated their HP Matrix Infrastructure orchestration suite and how it works with vCloud Director.&nbsp; It organizes and automates the integration and backend creation of a provider DC.</p>
<p>NetApp- Playing for Be The Match, helps DNA matching for bone marrow</p>
<p>Data ON Tap infrastructure is the demo.&nbsp; How do you demo that per Dave Hitz.&nbsp; Peak Colo is going to be used an example of how NetApp helps them out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone in Peak Colo gets a vSAN since all the infrastructure is shared overall and the vSAN is for each customer.</p>
<p>NetApp won and VMware is donating $10,000 to Be The Match.</p>
