  content: ! 'i had the same problems. in addition to setting the ACL, i also had
    to enable acl inheritance through:


    zfs set aclinherit=passthrough usbpool&#47;storage


    also i made bad experiences with casesensitivity=mixed: if there''s a file "File1.txt",
    and an unix user creates a file "file1.txt", both filenames are "renamed" for
    CIFS access. casesensitivity=insensitive works much better for me.'

    for.


    Unfortunately the chmod command gave the following error:

    zaphod@thebook:&#47;tank&#47;test$ chmod A=group@:rwxpdDaARWcCos:fd:allow .

    chmod: invalid mode: `A=group@:rwxpdDaARWcCos:fd:allow''

    Try `chmod --help'' for more information.


    Any thoughts would be appreciated. I''m on snv_134b'

<p>One of the issues with running a file server in the home is the fact that you have multiple computers and accounts (the wife, the kids etc) accessing the same directory trees.   The default user&#47;group works pretty well as you have effectively a single group for family access.  Different groups are used for more computer based access needs such as server to server communication.   However I found that the kernel CIFS doesn't create files with proper access very well using the standard UNIX permissions. </p>
<p>ACLs are the solution in this case.   </p>
<p><code># zfs create -o casesensitivity=mixed -o sharesmb=name=storage -o quota=275G usbpool&#47;storage<br />
# cd &#47;usbpool&#47;storage<br />
# chgrp home .<br />
# chmod A=group@:rwxpdDaARWcCos:fd:allow .<&#47;code></p>
<p>Now when you create a new folder or files under this CIFS folder it creates them with the group permissions.   I leave everyone in the same group and can add the secondary group as necessary for different shares needing permissions.   </p>
<p>When users create files they are created with:</p>
<p><code>----rwx---+  1 me   home       7930 Feb  7  2008 test.txt<&#47;code></p>
<p>And when they create directories they are:</p>
<p><code>d---rwx---+  2 me   home            3 Feb  9 22:10 OpenSolaris<&#47;code></p>
<p>Doable and functional.  I still wish there was better documentation that I could find around the ACL permissions and how they work.  I'm doing testing and I know I'm missing things.   </p>
