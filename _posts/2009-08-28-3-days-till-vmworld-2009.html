<p>Woot.  3 days until I hit San Francisco and begin the awesomeness that is VMworld.   I've got my schedule packed and for a first I'm getting asked to take a peek of a couple different vendor products from people internal to the company.   These folks want to get input on if these products will be useful for our different internal efforts with respect to our virtualization environments and OS environments.  (Note.. if you don't catch the mega WOOTness here you should now.  VMware is becoming a noticeably important tool at director and above levels.)</p>
