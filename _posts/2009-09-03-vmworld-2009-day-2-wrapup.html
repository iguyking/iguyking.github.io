<p>Day two at VMworld ended up being quite a bit more exciting than yesterday.&nbsp; The keynote by Steve Herrod was much more what I expected from the keynotes.&nbsp;&nbsp; He covered some of the "cool" stuff coming down the pipes in both the short term and longer term.&nbsp;&nbsp; The PCoIP demo showing Google Earth zooming up and down while connected to a machine in Portland, OR from the Moscone Center rocked.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to have that to use while I'm sitting in the hotel room's blazing fast&nbsp;speeds while attempting to do something useful&nbsp;on one of my machines at home instead of using RDP with SSL.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to the IO DRS Tech Preview and got the same excitement I've had from previous years where you know your seeing something innovative.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of the other sessions I hit were really partner style presentations that did not say much.&nbsp;&nbsp; So a good 25&#47;75 day for sessions which is pretty good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that the Self Service Labs were finally working properly I gave a shot at the vCenter Orchestrator product offering.&nbsp; The Lab was responsive and well documented.&nbsp; It was pretty nice and really hinted at the power this system can offer for DataCenter Automation.&nbsp; The theory is this is free with vSphere 4 so I'm going to have to really look into that and find out.</p>
<p>During my open times during the day I had some good meetings with some VMware employees to discuss some of the vStorage &amp; vCloud directions, HP&nbsp;folks around OpenView and Virtualization tools, AMD &amp; Intel on their functionality&nbsp;futures and&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitachi around their multipathing technology for VMware (still no roadmap).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Party was fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreigner still knows how to rock and I can actually climb rock walls.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nice thing about the party this year is it was right at the Moscone Center.</p>
<p>A very productive and long day.</p>
