  content: How is that better than Sun's x6450 blade (http:&#47;&#47;www.sun.com&#47;servers&#47;blades&#47;x6450&#47;)
    which will take up to four six-core Xeons, has 24 DIMM slots allowing for 192GB
    of RAM and also manages to make it on to the supported list?

  content: I'm not sold on the half-height blade concept either.  Keep in mind the
    chassis has a split mid-plane.  So what happens if the upper or lower half of
    the mid-plane fails (and yes it can happen).  If 8 blades go down that's 80+ VMs
    failing instantly.

  content: ! "VMware ESX drivers for the BL495c can be found in the following support
    page:\n\nhttp:&#47;&#47;h20000.www2.hp.com&#47;bizsupport&#47;TechSupport&#47;DriverDownload.jsp?prodNameId=3621782&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;taskId=135&amp;prodClassId=-1&amp;prodTypeId=3709945&amp;prodSeriesId=3621769\n\nI
    am not an expert in virtualization, and hope that you can provide an opinion:
    what is the advantage of using the BL495c over say the BL460c in VMware environments?
    \ \n\nOn one of our projects, we are looking to manage disparate development,
    testing and staging environments and applications where the hardware and software
    configurations change over time."

    BL495c is a much denser package than the Sun&rsquo;s x6450.  It has 2 major advantages
    over the BL460c; twice the memory, and Flex-10 NICs.  The onboard Flex-10 NICs
    can be configured as up to 8 NICs with only 2 VC modules. \n\nhttp:&#47;&#47;h18000.www1.hp.com&#47;products&#47;blades&#47;components&#47;ethernet&#47;10-10gb-f&#47;benefits.html?jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN"

<p>HP finally came out with the official information on the heavy duty blade for use in VMware environments.&nbsp;&nbsp; This blade for the c-Chassis is the <a title="BL495c Marketing Page" href="http:&#47;&#47;h18004.www1.hp.com&#47;products&#47;servers&#47;proliant-bl&#47;c-class&#47;495c-g5&#47;index.html" target="_blank">BL495c<&#47;a> which has 16 slots for Memory DIMMs and two AMD Opteron processors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its the official Virtualization Blade.</p>
<p>There's just a couple of gotchas here coming from someone that would like to use them:</p>
<ul>
<li>It comes with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;h18004.www1.hp.com&#47;products&#47;quickspecs&#47;13140_div&#47;13140_div.html" target="_blank">2 10Gb builtin ethernet<&#47;a> connections.&nbsp; There's no interconnect module right now that can use this other than the pass thru.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well if your going to use an interconnect pass thru the whole purpose of blades for being able to reduce cabling and simplify management.&nbsp; You might as well just use rack mounts as they give you more flexiblity and control and your just buying what you need.<&#47;li>
<li>It has the option of coming with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;h18004.www1.hp.com&#47;products&#47;quickspecs&#47;13140_div&#47;13140_div.html#Storage" target="_blank">SSD drives<&#47;a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your doing serious virtualization the last thing you need in a physical instance is anything that ties you to that physical instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The SSD is a short term solution and I don't care if its faster (that's the big deal with SSD Drives - faster). &nbsp; The future for serious virtualization solutions is zero ties to the hardware all served out from a central system.&nbsp; Personally I think PXE is going to be the answer to this issue.<&#47;li>
<li> There's no support listed for VMware ESX in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;h20000.www2.hp.com&#47;bizsupport&#47;TechSupport&#47;DriverDownload.jsp?prodNameId=3813532&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodTypeId=15351&amp;prodSeriesId=3782978&amp;taskId=135" target="_blank">support pages<&#47;a>.&nbsp; I thought HP was a huge VMware Partner?&nbsp; Easily the single largest Server Virtualization Vendor in the business and you don't support it though you have Marketing statements like "the world's first virtualization blade"?<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I think the HP BL495c has the potential to be a fantastic product to use since this is a half height blade so you can get 16 blades in 10U of rack space.&nbsp; There's just a couple of gotchas right now.</p>
