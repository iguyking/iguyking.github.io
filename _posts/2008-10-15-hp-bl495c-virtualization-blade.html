  content: How is that better than Sun's x6450 blade (http://www.sun.com/servers/blades/x6450/)
    which will take up to four six-core Xeons, has 24 DIMM slots allowing for 192GB
    of RAM and also manages to make it on to the supported list?

  content: I'm not sold on the half-height blade concept either.  Keep in mind the
    chassis has a split mid-plane.  So what happens if the upper or lower half of
    the mid-plane fails (and yes it can happen).  If 8 blades go down that's 80+ VMs
    failing instantly.

  content: ! "VMware ESX drivers for the BL495c can be found in the following support
    page:\n\nhttp://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/DriverDownload.jsp?prodNameId=3621782&lang=en&cc=us&taskId=135&prodClassId=-1&prodTypeId=3709945&prodSeriesId=3621769\n\nI
    am not an expert in virtualization, and hope that you can provide an opinion:
    what is the advantage of using the BL495c over say the BL460c in VMware environments?
    \ \n\nOn one of our projects, we are looking to manage disparate development,
    testing and staging environments and applications where the hardware and software
    configurations change over time."

    BL495c is a much denser package than the Sun&rsquo;s x6450.  It has 2 major advantages
    over the BL460c; twice the memory, and Flex-10 NICs.  The onboard Flex-10 NICs
    can be configured as up to 8 NICs with only 2 VC modules. \n\nhttp://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/blades/components/ethernet/10-10gb-f/benefits.html?jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN"

<p>HP finally came out with the official information on the heavy duty blade for use in VMware environments.   This blade for the c-Chassis is the <a title="BL495c Marketing Page" href="http://h18004.www1.hp.com/products/servers/proliant-bl/c-class/495c-g5/index.html" target="_blank">BL495c</a> which has 16 slots for Memory DIMMs and two AMD Opteron processors.   Its the official Virtualization Blade.</p>
<p>There's just a couple of gotchas here coming from someone that would like to use them:</p>
<ul>
<li>It comes with <a href="http://h18004.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/13140_div/13140_div.html" target="_blank">2 10Gb builtin ethernet</a> connections.  There's no interconnect module right now that can use this other than the pass thru.   Well if your going to use an interconnect pass thru the whole purpose of blades for being able to reduce cabling and simplify management.  You might as well just use rack mounts as they give you more flexiblity and control and your just buying what you need.</li>
<li>It has the option of coming with <a href="http://h18004.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/13140_div/13140_div.html#Storage" target="_blank">SSD drives</a>.   If your doing serious virtualization the last thing you need in a physical instance is anything that ties you to that physical instance.   The SSD is a short term solution and I don't care if its faster (that's the big deal with SSD Drives - faster).   The future for serious virtualization solutions is zero ties to the hardware all served out from a central system.  Personally I think PXE is going to be the answer to this issue.</li>
<li> There's no support listed for VMware ESX in the <a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/DriverDownload.jsp?prodNameId=3813532&lang=en&cc=us&prodTypeId=15351&prodSeriesId=3782978&taskId=135" target="_blank">support pages</a>.  I thought HP was a huge VMware Partner?  Easily the single largest Server Virtualization Vendor in the business and you don't support it though you have Marketing statements like "the world's first virtualization blade"?</li><br />
</ul><br />
I think the HP BL495c has the potential to be a fantastic product to use since this is a half height blade so you can get 16 blades in 10U of rack space.  There's just a couple of gotchas right now.</p>
