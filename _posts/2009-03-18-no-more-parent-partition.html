<p>Microsoft has renamed the Parent Partition in Hyper-V.&nbsp; It is now called the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;virtual_pc_guy&#47;archive&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;04&#47;hyper-v-terminology-update.aspx" target="_self">Management Operating System<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Nice that Microsoft folks are starting to admit in passing that their is a heavy dependency on this MOS.&nbsp; Giving it a real name is a starting point.</p>
