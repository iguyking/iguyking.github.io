<p>Live Blog and notes taken during the session</p>
<p>Steve Herrod, VMware CTO, presenting for the General Session 2.</p>
<p>One of the great changes is the shift from servers and technology to End Devices and Services. &nbsp; Universal access to the environment is critical part of this. &nbsp;As such these have high expectations compared to past environments in computing. &nbsp; DUH! (Devices, Universal Access, High Expectations).</p>
<p>Directions that need to address the DUH is IT needs to simplify, manage and connect the end folks to the services they care about. &nbsp; Desktop services will be need to be contained and compartmentalized. &nbsp; This includes the full Desktop (View) or just the applications (Thinapp). &nbsp; Now if we can separate the Desktop, the Applications and the Data apart from each other, powerful policies can do quite a bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;Once this is done User&#47;Application&#47;Data policies can take place.</p>
<p>View is the direct solution to handle the Desktop Service. &nbsp;Well known and announced View 5.0.</p>
<p>To handle applications ThinApp is the direction being followed. &nbsp; There is a new service called ThinApp Factory as part of the application store. &nbsp; This tool will help auto create ThinApp packages. &nbsp; Fully automated creations of these packages following some&nbsp;recipes.</p>
<p>Project Octopus deals with the data service layer. &nbsp;This is built around providing a dropbox equivalent services in an enterprise. &nbsp;http:&#47;&#47;www.vmwareoctopus.com</p>
<p>Horizon has a Mobile piece that allows IT to securely gain access to the application space. &nbsp; Along with that is the Mobile Virtual Machine space. &nbsp; As part of pushing the access&#47;application, can have a controlled&#47;contained environment on the phone.</p>
<p>One of the great things coming is a feature called AppBlast. &nbsp; It can present the application, not a full desktop to devices like an iThing. &nbsp;This works on HTML5, not a custom unique protocol to deliver it. &nbsp;So to edit an Excel presentation on an iPad, just connect to the internal IT and work with Excel.</p>
<p>vSphere 5 is the basis for all of this. &nbsp; The HyperVisor is still not a commodity as many of these powerful features come from the fact that the base is solid and functional.</p>
<p>vSphere 5 can now handle 32 vCPUs, 1,000GB RAM, 1 Million per Host. &nbsp;Melvin the Monster VM has come.</p>
<p>Some of the other great features are around performance guarantees. Storage IO assurance is good. &nbsp; By creating Storage Pools, can organize by application, purpose, performance and other validations. &nbsp;Once a pool is created, automation on placement can take place. &nbsp; Along with that can perform DRS with Storage now using Storage VMotion. &nbsp; This can be done automatically. &nbsp; Setup the policies and forget about it as the infrastructure deals with it.</p>
<p>vSphere 5 allows the IT admin to now set Storage I&#47;O Control to assure performance. &nbsp;Dealing with the noisy neighbor is a significant issue to control as the central system in the hypervisor. &nbsp;Along with that network I&#47;O control has arrived also.</p>
<p>As the future comes to pass, one of the largest challenges is the IP problem. &nbsp; Right now networking in the TCP&#47;IP stack is built with Location = Identifier. &nbsp; If a machine wants to move around, the location and Identifier are tied together. &nbsp;For example moving a VM from an internal Cloud to an External Cloud the VM needs to be given a new IP. &nbsp;This can be a very disruptive activity.</p>
<p>VMware has a solution now called VXLAN which is Virtual eXtensible LAN. &nbsp; This technology has been worked on with Intel, Emulex, Cisco, Arista, Broadcom. &nbsp; The spec has been sent to IETF. &nbsp; This is a big step on the virtualization solution. &nbsp; Once this tie has been broken cloud mobility becomes feasible and deliverable.</p>
<p>Management is the end game after a solid reportable infrastructure is available. &nbsp; From there the approach is</p>
<ol>
<li>Monitor<&#47;li>
<li>Correlate<&#47;li>
<li>Remediate<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
<div>At the end the focus is that End User Computing is making a major shift soon. &nbsp; This shift is coming with massive improvements in the client experience into something that the clients actually want. &nbsp;All this is possible by simplifying the layers under neath so time can be spent on this new functionality. &nbsp; To do that management of these spaces needs to be come more automated.<&#47;div></p>
