<p>I went to two other sessions and they just weren't anything I was intersted in so I left early and spent time talking with engineers from various companies about their products.&nbsp;&nbsp; So far I'm not really too wowed by much of the products.&nbsp;&nbsp; This fits into my feelings about the keynote after it was done.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not really wowed at all.&nbsp; No new product announcements, version announcements or even serious tech previews.&nbsp;&nbsp; The one I was all excited to see on the big screen was the PCoIP and they rushed through that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vCloud announcement was nice as it is starting to get somewhat defined for the industry.&nbsp; Thanks to Jian Zhen (zhenjl) from VMware for pointing me to the <a title="VMware vCloud API" href="http:&#47;&#47;VMware.com&#47;go&#47;vcloudapi" target="_blank">vCloud API<&#47;a>.&nbsp; I'll be reading through that this week.&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably on the flight home knowing me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the investment by companies like <a title="Terremark vCloudExpress" href="http:&#47;&#47;vcloudexpress.terremark.com&#47;" target="_blank">Terremark<&#47;a> already for "on demand servers access" is nice and in the ranges of cost feasibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall&nbsp;the day has been productive and less than exciting.</p>
