<p>Is this true?&nbsp; If so what's Oracle's game plan? They just buy Virtual Iron for a virtualization management.  Appear to have a clue since they are buying Sun with a huge virtualization skill set and product line.   Then this info comes along?</p>
<p>http:&#47;&#47;www.theregister.co.uk&#47;2009&#47;06&#47;19&#47;oracle_kills_virtual_iron&#47;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In a letter to Virtual Iron's sales partners, Oracle says it "will suspend development of existing Virtual Iron products and will suspend delivery of orders to new customers." And in a second letter to a partner speaking with <em>The Reg<&#47;em>, the company says it will not allow partners to sell new licenses to anyone - including existing customers - after the end of this month.<&#47;p></p>
<p>So is Oracle's plan just to cannibalize Sun &amp; Virtual Iron's code and forsake all the customers they bought?</p>
<p>Makes me pretty sad since I'm a big Sun fan with OpenSolaris and I have the fear that they will do the same thing there.</p>
