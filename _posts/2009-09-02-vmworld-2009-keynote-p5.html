<p>To expand and handle the next layers of Virtualization is:</p>
<p><strong>vSphere Control:<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Appspeed: is the "finger of blame" now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of Network always getting the finger, now AppSpeed can point the finger at someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>vApps are the containers of the future for applications be it standalone or multi-tier.&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea is with a vApp is that it has a variety of attributes&#47;metadata such as Availability, RTOs for dR, Max Latency etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; This info travels with the vApp.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>VMsafe APIs:&nbsp;&nbsp; This gives control of security and compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nice thing is this is more appropriate data tied to a vApp via the attributes&#47;metadata and the various vendors such as Trend&#47;McAfee&#47;Symantec&#47;RSA etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Example would be Needs these firewall rules and capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>vCenter ConfigControl:&nbsp;&nbsp; The demo showed that ConfigControl really has</p>
<p>vSphere Choice:</p>
<p>LabManager is the token self service portal today.</p>
<p>VMworld today:</p>
<p>37,248 machines -</p>
<p>if physical --> 25 MegaWatts - 3 football fields of space</p>
<p>with VMware Virtualization - Down to 776 physical servers&nbsp;running 540 Kilowatts</p>
<p><strong>vCloud<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Priority is around the internal cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next is working on bringing internal datacenter trust and capabilities to the external clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 3rd innovation is how and what can you do once you have these two pieces and how they interact and connectivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today Site Recovery Manager is the first step into the Connectivity space.&nbsp;&nbsp; When and how and what needs to take place to failover from one datacenter to another one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long Distance VMotion:&nbsp;&nbsp; The challenges - Move VMs Memory, Disk consistency&#47;syncing and VM network id&#47;connections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the Sun&#47;Moon approaches (moving computing to stay during the night and cheaper issues)&nbsp;<&#47;li>
<li>Disaster Datacenter Avoidance - Hurricane coming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Move the Datacenter somewhere out of the path.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Cisco does this by spanning Layer 2 across both campuses up to 300KM apart.&nbsp;<br />
F5 uses its iSession technology to move things around through a globally based load balancer system.</p>
<p>Interoperability:&nbsp; vCloud API</p>
<p>vSphere Plugins with your hosting provider to maintain the Single Pane of Glass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Standards.&nbsp;&nbsp; The end goal is it will work regardless of where you go or what hypervizor is used.&nbsp;&nbsp; The end goal is to have a good eco system and selection for end clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>vApps&nbsp;<&#47;strong>&nbsp; Automation for the app stacks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Spring Source helps go down this path.&nbsp; Much discussion around splitting up Infrastructure, Applications, Platform and separating these to create well defined interaction points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spring Source Demo shows some of the process capabilities to control deployment and put some controls around it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Things like CloudFoundry.&nbsp; For those of us the contest is on.. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.code2cloud.com">http:&#47;&#47;www.code2cloud.com<&#47;a> for backstage pass to see Foreigner.&nbsp; (Oh wait.. maybe I shouldn't post that)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Till the next time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm off to IO DRS Tech Preview.</p>
