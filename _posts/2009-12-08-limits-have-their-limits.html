  content: Excellent post! I just wanted to add an amen to the memory limits point.
    We came across that exact same scenario (except vCenter 2.5), where increasing
    memory set a limit. We never would have caught it if it weren't for vFogLight
    (and probably other monitoring software). It raised a ballooning alarm, which
    pointed us to a solution quickly. This is one of the reasons why I recommend a
    monitoring tool. I really hope that the what-I-think-is-a-bug is fixed with vSphere.

<p>I've been chewing on this <a title="Using limits instead of downscaling" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.yellow-bricks.com&#47;2009&#47;09&#47;25&#47;using-limits-instead-of-downscaling&#47;" target="_blank">post<&#47;a> by Duncan at Yellow Bricks for the past month and a half.&nbsp; It covers some complicated issues that one has to deal with in a enterprise size environment with many assumptions on what gets you into this mess in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp; The best thing to do is downscale and upscale as needed based on good performance monitoring and bottleneck research.&nbsp; Thankfully I've managed to make good relationships with most teams where I work that this has become the standard operating procedure though sometimes we just can't. &nbsp; At the end of the day the issue boils down to the simple goal:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As the VMware environment administrator, how can I make better use of what I have available to me?"<&#47;p></p>
<p>For my environment I run into a variety of political reasons going from..</p>
<ul>
<li>"I am going to need that extra 2 CPUs someday in the future so I can't give them up now."<&#47;li>
<li>"The vendor docs say I really do need 8 CPUs and 128G of RAM for my 3 users even though 126G is unused."<&#47;li>
<li>"Someone on your team said I really do need that 8G of RAM so I won't give it up"<&#47;li>
<li>"Oh come on.. what's another 2G of RAM"<&#47;li>
<li>"I gave up my budget for a physical to do this as a virtual even though I'm still spending less in the grand scheme.&nbsp; Gimme more resources."<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
to the begging</p>
<ul>
<li>"Pleaseeee.&nbsp; I think it'll help my issues.&nbsp; It might even make me look better to my co-workers."<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I have two distinct use cases that really showcase that this kind of capability can be a hard item to use.</p>
<p><strong><em>Case #1:&nbsp; The poorly written VBscript<br />
<&#47;em><&#47;strong></p>
<p>Back in the early Windows 3.1 days when VB was a novel concept, some developers made this ground breaking app that would pull data from a remote system, massage the data a bit and put it into a centralized Btrieve database.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well this script that they wrote goes to sleep for a minute after the remote system's queue it checks is empty.&nbsp; This script sleep function checks the clock to see if a minute has passed.&nbsp; It constantly checks the clock which consumes 100% of the CPU all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; This wasn't much of an issue when each one of these systems was on its own old PC system.&nbsp; We virtualized them since 16 XP workstations in the datacenter is a management headache.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that's 16 high power, multiple generation newer cores being used 100% all day long for no good reason.</p>
<p>We, VMware Admins, have discovered that on the old PCs these systems would easily take 5-10 mins to work through their work queues.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the newest hardware we have with these as VMs, it takes under 15 seconds to do the same work.&nbsp;&nbsp; So for 60 seconds it is doing nothing except checking the hardware clock.</p>
<p><em><strong>Solution #1:&nbsp; CPU limits good<br />
<&#47;strong><&#47;em></p>
<p>We implemented a CPU limiting resource pool for these VBscript VMs.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are still running mega fast in comparison to where they were a year ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now they are using no more than 8 cores worth at any given time.&nbsp; A big improvement until the app developers decide if they are going to replace all that code with <em>sleep 60<&#47;em> or recode the entire app.</p>
<p><em><strong>Case #2:&nbsp; vCenter SQL Server Memory Limits<&#47;strong><&#47;em></p>
<p>Due to a feature in vCenter 4.0U1 and ESX 3.5 Hosts, when I increased the RAM on my vCenter dedicated SQL Server from 4G to 8G, a Memory limit was set of 4G.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I would go onto the SQL instance, SQL Server.exe would only be using about 3600 Megs yet all 8G was consumed&#47;used.&nbsp;&nbsp; This screamed to me an issue with the OS instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; After close to 10 days of head beating and not understanding why my brand new vCenter 4.0U1 system was running so poorly, a co-worker with a fresh set of eyes noticed this setting on the SQL Server instance.</p>
<p><em><strong>Solution #2:&nbsp; Memory limits bad<&#47;strong><&#47;em></p>
<p>This is obvious.&nbsp; We disabled the limit and the SQL Server performance went through the roof instantly. We simply couldn't tell easily that the driver was using 4G of RAM as it wasn't a process.&nbsp; Nobody noticed the ballooning happening.</p>
<p>At the end of the day there's pros and cons to having this level of capabilities.&nbsp; This is why I like ESX and the general approach of VMware.&nbsp;&nbsp; Give you everything we can in terms of options, configurations and rope to hang yourself and two of your friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will attempt to automate this and hide this as much as we can.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vendor will never know all the situations we, people in the field, are going to run into so let's give us all the options they can.&nbsp; Use that rope with caution.</p>
