<p>The year, the past.</p>
<p>The place, a convention in a week.</p>
<p>I'm prepped.  I'm ready.  I'm excited.  I'm nervous.  I've got a presentation I'm going to do.  There's going to be tons of announcements and product releases.   I'm working myself into a frenzy about everything that's going to happen and things I need to be ready for and and and...</p>
<p>Needless to say at this point I need a stiff drink.  My friends know that doesn't work so they come over and we start talking.   Lots of silliness in-sued and stress occurred.  Something fun that came out of that stress release is a game that I like to do about the next convention I'm heading to.</p>
<p>Rules of the Prophecy Game:</p>
<ol>
<li>You get a point for each item you bring up first that happens.</li>
<li>If it is NDA, can't mention it.   No fair to the game as you already know the announcement and we don't want you getting in trouble.</li>
<li>If it is massively public knowledge, you can say it, you just don't get points for it coming true.  (Team vote if prophecy is public knowledge already.)</li>
<li>Winner at end of convention for most points gets crowned "Oracle of VMworld2010".</li><br />
</ol><br />
What do I think that will happen at VMworld 2010?</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of Booths with uninformed Booth Babes/Dudes will be less than VMworld2009</li>
<li>Session turnout will be smaller on average than last year</li>
<li>iPad is the raffle gift of choice this year (a gimme I know)</li>
<li>EMC will show some incredible tech (VPLEX) that will encourage VMware to one-up it</li>
<li>vD0dgeball will have a significant turnout of vSquirrels, vSpecialists and just everyone
<ul>
<li>vSpecialists are going to win 5 out of 9 games</li><br />
</ul><br />
</li></p>
<li>Symantec will have some new product that will attempt to replace some VMware supplied tech and be rather disruptive to your environment again instead of using APIs supplied</li>
<li>Citrix or Microsoft will have some marketing approach that is rather childish</li>
<li>Lots of VMware announcements about the Ionix acquisition</li>
<li>Twitter will hit a good 30k tweets in #vmworld</li>
<li>@jTroyer will get 2 hours of sleep a night all week</li>
<li>@Lynxbat will announce some cool enhancement to a virtual appliance</li><br />
</ul><br />
That being said here's my prophecies on VMware's product line and keynotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will announce general availability of VMware's first Cloud Delivery Tool (Likely called Service Director) for your own private cloud</li>
<li>Announce cross datacenter vMotion & Storage vMotion capabilities</li>
<li>VMware will purchase Teradici for $50mil</li>
<li>Will announce VMware is getting into selling servers (everyone else is doing it why not VMware?)</li>
<li>View 4.next will finally go GA</li>
<li>VMware join the battle to buy 3Par</li><br />
</ul><br />
What do you think will happen at VMworld 2010?</p>
