<p>Just announced at VMworld 2010 is the "Cloud Application Platform" layer in the new focus for VMware.&nbsp;&nbsp; This layer covers the Spring Source functionality, Hyperic monitoring solution and the new <em>vFabric<&#47;em> solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The focus of this is around the New Applications that you develop or bring into the business.</p>
<p>The Spring framework and the Hyperic are fairly well known on the web.&nbsp; As such I'm not going to take much time on this. &nbsp; The key in this is that this layer is all about the primitives available to developers in an easy to use and reasonable standardized way. &nbsp; Development speed now is extremely important even more so than in the past. &nbsp; Part of what drives this is the popularity of the scripting&#47;interpreted style languages. &nbsp; One reason is the speed of development. &nbsp; The other is the wide variety of libraries&#47;APIs that are easy to use to do what is needed in the application.</p>
<p>The <em>vFabric<&#47;em> solution from VMware at its core is going to be a framework including monitoring interfaces of Cloud Friendly primitives.&nbsp; This API will help the development of those new applications to be Cloud ready.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time it is broken into two different groups of services.</p>
<p>Spring Frameworks &amp; Tools will include the following primitives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rich Web interfaces<&#47;li>
<li>Integration Services<&#47;li>
<li>Batch processing<&#47;li>
<li>Data Access<&#47;li>
<li>Social Media (not just Facebook&#47;Twitter)<&#47;li>
<li>Cloud APIs<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Some of the Common System Services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application Management &amp; Monitoring (Hyperic)<&#47;li>
<li>Data Management (GemFire for non-lasting data)<&#47;li>
<li>Messaging (RabbitMQ)<&#47;li>
<li>Dynamic Load Balancing<&#47;li>
<li>Web Server (tc Server)<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
One key thing is these are for programming a new application which is Cloud ready and friendly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not just a VMware Cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any cloud that offers a reasonable amount of functionality via APIs should be able to run these frameworks.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <em>vFabric <&#47;em>solution is being developed to work with the private Cloud, vmForce and development is ongoing with Google to allow <em>vFabric<&#47;em> applications in the Google App Engine.</p>
<p>The last piece of of this is that one of the design goals is to have <em>vFabric<&#47;em> work with Java, Ruby and other languages.&nbsp;&nbsp; This should not be limited to just one language.</p>
<p><em>vFabric<&#47;em> offers a strong direction to improve development functionality for companies and allow IT to spend less time provisioning everything.&nbsp; Instead just deliver a common platform and manage the apps, not the infrastructure.</p>
