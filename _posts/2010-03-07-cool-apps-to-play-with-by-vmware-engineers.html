<p>Came across <a title="VMware Labs" href="http://labs.vmware.com" target="_self">VMware Labs</a> website today.   A nice website for VMware to show case the quality work that its employees are developing to improve the general vSphere environment.  I have used or looked at 1/2 of these and was pleasantly surprised to discover some new tools.</p>
<p>Per the site manifest:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is our place to share cool tools created by VMware engineers.   There is a wide range of tools here for you, including one for  automating tasks, getting ESX performance graphs, a rich Internet  application framework and much more. These tools are offered under <a href="http://labs.vmware.com/terms-of-use">Technical Preview</a> or  relevant Open Source License.</blockquote><br />
They are calling each app/tool/API a <em>fling</em>.   This is a pretty smart naming.   I have seen several start up companies employees start making some cool code that never gets to see the light of day.   They are just <em>flings of interest</em> to help a specific problem.   They don't always become full fledged products.</p>
<p>Here's the current list:</p>
<p><a title="Apache Pivot" href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/pivot" target="_blank">Apache Pivot</a></p>
<p>Like most modern development platforms, Pivot provides a comprehensive  set of  foundation classes that together comprise a "framework". These  classes form the building blocks upon which more complex and  sophisticated applications can be built.</p>
<p><a title="Dynamo RIO" href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/dynamo-rio" target="_blank">Dynamo RIO</a></p>
<p>DynamoRIO exports <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/dynamorio.org');" rel="nofollow" href="http://dynamorio.org/docs/">an  interface</a> for building dynamic tools for a wide variety of uses:  program analysis and understanding, profiling, instrumentation,  optimization, translation, etc. Unlike many dynamic tool systems,  DynamoRIO is not limited to insertion of callouts/trampolines and allows  arbitrary modifications to application instructions via a powerful  IA-32/AMD64 instruction manipulation library. DynamoRIO provides  efficient, transparent, and comprehensive manipulation of unmoOndified  applications running on stock operating systems (Windows or Linux) and  commodity IA-32 and AMD64.</p>
<p><a title="esxplot" href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/esxplot" target="_blank">esxplot</a></p>
<p>Esxplot is a GUI based tool that lets you explore the data collected by  esxtop in batch mode. The program loads  files of this data and presents  it as a hierarchical tree where the values are selectable in the left  panel of the tool, graphs of the selected metrics are plotted in the  right panel.</p>
<p><a title="Onyx" href="http://http://labs.vmware.com/flings/onyx" target="_blank">Onyx</a></p>
<p>Onyx is a standalone application that serves as a proxy between the  vSphere Client and the vCenter Server. It monitors the network  communication between them and translates it into an executable  PowerShell code. Later this code could be modified and saved into a  reusable function or script.</p>
<p><a title="SVGA Sonar" href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/svga-sonar" target="_blank">SVGA Sonar</a></p>
<p>VGA Sonar is a demo application for SVGADevTap. SVGADevTap is a  user-level library that communicates with the VMware SVGA guest driver  to provide low-latency notifications of changes to the screen.</p>
<p><a title="vApprun" href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/vaprun" target="_blank">vApprun</a></p>
<p>The vApprun tool implements the same vApp/OVF feature set as the vSphere  4 release. Thus, Workstation/Fusion can be used as a development  environment for advanced OVF packages, and it can be used to evaluate  and test OVF packages on your desktops and laptops.</p>
<p><a title="vCMA" href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/vcma" target="_blank">vCMA</a></p>
<p>VMware <strong>vCenter Mobile Access (</strong>vCMA) - vCMA allows you  to monitor and manage VMware Infrastructure from your mobile phone with  an interface that is optimized for such devices.</p>
<p><a title="VGC" href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/vgc" target="_blank">VGC</a></p>
<p>VMware Guest Console allows you to manage the Guest OSes from the VMware layer.</p>
<p><a title="VI Java" href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/vi-java" target="_blank">VI Java</a></p>
<p>vSphere Java API is a set of Java libraries that sits on top of existing  vSphere SDK Web Services interfaces. It provides full managed object  model and run-time type checking, resulting dramatic productivity boost.  With the new Web Services engine in 2.0, it also performs much faster  than engines like Apache AXIS up to 15 times.</p>
<p><a title="Virtual USB Analyzer" href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/virtualusb" target="_blank">Virtual USB Analyzer</a></p>
<p>The Virtual USB Analyzer is a free and open source tool for visualizing  logs of USB packets, from hardware or software USB sniffer tools. As far  as we know, it's the world's first tool to provide a graphical  visualization along with raw hex dumps and high-level protocol analysis.</p>
<p>If you want to see what is possible with a companies products, these are some of the tools to go look at.  <a title="VMware Labs" href="http://labs.vmware.com" target="_blank">http://labs.vmware.com</a></p>
