<p>Overall VMworld 2008 went fairly well.&nbsp; I had a good time and learned a bit about a variety of new areas in the Virtual Product markets.&nbsp; Some new companies products trying to fit into the VDI world like <a title="TeraDici" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.teradici.com" target="_blank">Teradici<&#47;a>'s PC over IP technology.&nbsp; Some very interesting new implementations of existing technology (probably a customer said something like.. You know I could use this, this way, and if you gave it to me as an appliance I could buy it) like Platespin's <a title="Platespin Forge" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.platespin.com&#47;products&#47;forge&#47;" target="_blank">Forge <&#47;a>product for Business Continuity. &nbsp; Finally, <a title="Egenera" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.egenera.com&#47;" target="_blank">Egenera<&#47;a> has an interesting product that separates out I&#47;O hardware subsystem from the Processing system (CPU).&nbsp; I did appreciate the new <a title="vDC-OS" href="http:&#47;&#47;itsjustanotherlayer.com&#47;?p=7" target="_blank">leadership directions<&#47;a> of Paul Maritz and do honor the original leadership of founder's Diane Greene and Mendel Rosenblum.</p>
<p>My basic comments boil down to a comparison between Las Vegas &amp; San Francisco:</p>
<p><strong>Las Vegas is a Party Place and not good for a serious conference.<br />
<&#47;strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Many of the sessions I went to were fairly empty even though there was more people at this conference (14k) versus last year (10k).&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading Twitters, blogs and overhearing people talking about why they didn't make sessions such as "too much partying last night", "too much drinking", "too much gambling".&nbsp;&nbsp; (And that's even giving leniency for the day after the VMworld Party.)&nbsp; It really left me wanting from the conference in the Birds of a Feather sessions and panels.<&#47;p></p>
<p><strong>Las Vegas is the Anti-Green compared to San Francisco which is a Green Place.<&#47;strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In San Francisco everything was recycled or recyclable and reasonably healthy in the supplied breakfast and lunch menus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Las Vegas had at least one deep fried or hot McDonald's style microwaved item at every meal.<&#47;p></p>
<p><strong>Las Vegas Sands Expo really knows how to move people.<&#47;strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I never felt like I was waiting and not moving to get either to my sessions or to the supplied breakfast and lunch.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I headed in for Breakfast with the other 4k people that wanted breakfast, I'd always be moving until I got my food and sat down.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as our "grouping" of people eating was done, the staff would clean it up and make it ready for the next batch.&nbsp; They had people directing you on where to go, where to get your food, where to sit and where to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was mega impressed.<&#47;p></p>
<p>After saying all that, I did have a good time in Las Vegas and did meet up with a lot of developers, engineers, vendors and peers.&nbsp;&nbsp; So all and all this was not a waste or a loss in my book.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a worth while expenditure of time, money and energy and can't wait to go next year.</p>
