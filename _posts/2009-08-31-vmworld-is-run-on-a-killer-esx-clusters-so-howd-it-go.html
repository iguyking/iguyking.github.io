    Couldn''t a smaller, less power hungry infrastructure have provided the necessary
    demo capability? What was the average CPU utilisation of those 37000 VMs?'

<p>From a very interesting tweet:<br />
@MeghanAtBMC: VMWorld infrastructure is running 37,248 VM's on 776 ESX servers w&#47;total of 37TB of Memory 348TB Storage</p>
<p><strong>SWEET!!!<&#47;strong></p>
<p>The next set of questions coming from someone that manages a datacenter:</p>
<p>Can we get a whitepaper&#47;post mortem report on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How this datacenter ran during the show?<&#47;li>
<li>What issues did you see?<&#47;li>
<li>What worked well?<&#47;li>
<li>How many VMotions happened?<&#47;li>
<li>How many HA events occurred?<&#47;li>
<li>How many IOPS occurred?<&#47;li>
<li>How many last minute change requests for more CPU, Memory, Disk, Extra VMs come through?<&#47;li>
<li>What kind of change management was in place for this?<&#47;li>
<li>What were the support policies?<&#47;li>
<li>How many admins were involved?<&#47;li>
<li>How many hack attacks occurred?<&#47;li>
<li>What kind of security issues were seen?<&#47;li>
<li>What kind of repair worked happened?<&#47;li>
<li>What was Lab Manager used for?&nbsp;&nbsp;<&#47;li>
<li>What was View used for?&nbsp;&nbsp;<&#47;li>
<li>What versions of everything that were used?&nbsp;&nbsp;<&#47;li>
<li>Did you have any FT VMs?&nbsp;&nbsp; How did they work?<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Any other questions datacenter folks would be intersted in?&nbsp; I know I'm just itching to know.</p>
