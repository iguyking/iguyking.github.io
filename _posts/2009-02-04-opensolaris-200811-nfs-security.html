    it isn't in DNS.

<p>A quick note here after the past 4 hours of fighting with NFS on OpenSolaris 2008.11.   If you are attempting to do an mount and get a Permission Denied from either Linux or ESX the solution is rather easy.</p>
<p>Make sure that the IP address that you are connecting with has a reverse DNS entry with a hostname.   </p>
<p>That's it.   4 hours and that's the gotcha.   If you don't have a reverse DNS you'll never get the mount to work.</p>
