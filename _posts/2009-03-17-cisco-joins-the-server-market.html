<p>Today's <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/solutions/data_center/unifiedcomputing_promo.html?POSITION=sl&COUNTRY_SITE=us&CAMPAIGN=Data+Center+CA&CREATIVE=dccalaunch">big news</a>:</p>
<p>Cisco has come out with a single stop full solution rack for CPU, Disk & Network in one using all the best of virtualization technology of Storage, Server & Networking.   Tight VMware integration, all Cisco hardware & lots of virtualization technology at 10G.</p>
<p>Over the past several years I've kinda figured that Cisco has lost their way.  Floundering a bit.  Now I know someone at Cisco has a brain.   VMware has blazed the path in recent history into the Enterprise Datacenter.  The gotcha  has been trying to integrate with networking and storage.   This is in theory resolved by this solution of a fully integrated delivered product line.</p>
<p>So how does HP & IBM & Dell correspond with this?</p>
