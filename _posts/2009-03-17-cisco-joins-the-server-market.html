<p>Today's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cisco.com&#47;web&#47;solutions&#47;data_center&#47;unifiedcomputing_promo.html?POSITION=sl&amp;COUNTRY_SITE=us&amp;CAMPAIGN=Data+Center+CA&amp;CREATIVE=dccalaunch">big news<&#47;a>:</p>
<p>Cisco has come out with a single stop full solution rack for CPU, Disk &amp; Network in one using all the best of virtualization technology of Storage, Server &amp; Networking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tight VMware integration, all Cisco hardware &amp; lots of virtualization technology at 10G.</p>
<p>Over the past several years I've kinda figured that Cisco has lost their way.&nbsp; Floundering a bit.&nbsp; Now I know someone at Cisco has a brain.&nbsp;&nbsp; VMware has blazed the path in recent history into the Enterprise Datacenter.&nbsp; The gotcha&nbsp; has been trying to integrate with networking and storage.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is in theory resolved by this solution of a fully integrated delivered product line.</p>
<p>So how does HP &amp; IBM &amp; Dell correspond with this?</p>
