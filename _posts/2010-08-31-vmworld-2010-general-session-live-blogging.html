  content: The company that VMware acquired was Integrien (www.integrien.com), not
    Integreon (www.integreon.com). Similar names, but totally different companies.

<p>Hello one and all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its a Live Blog going down today.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoy the live blogging and check out @iankoenig on twitter for even more live information.</p>
<p>Update 9:04am:</p>
<p>Hanging out with Virtualization-spotlight.com owner chatting about the cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for the session to start.&nbsp; What coolness do we have this year?</p>
<p>Update: 9:10am:</p>
<p>The opening presentation video asks the great question of "What is the cloud?".&nbsp;&nbsp; A cute Matrix like fun here.. A great quote:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cloud is in your mind from the Oracle (not that company that needs some help)
<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="The Oracle from Matrix Defining the Cloud"]<img title="The Oracle from Matrix Defining the Cloud" src="http:&#47;&#47;web12.twitpic.com&#47;img&#47;154507981-6bf87163249d1221cc39aefbf9cf4a4a.4c7d2e08-scaled.jpg" alt="The Oracle from Matrix Defining the Cloud" width="600" height="450" &#47;>[&#47;caption]<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
17,021 total as of Monday night<br />
55 people attended all 7 VMworlds - The Alumni Elite</p>
<p>Update: 9:27am</p>
<p>Virtual Roads.&nbsp; Actual Clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp; The theme this year.</p>
<p>Starting down this road and it is a journey:</p>
<p>Most customers start with cost efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp; They find that money savings are huge.&nbsp;&nbsp; As they use it they find out that VMs are easier to manage and use.</p>
<p>The next step is Quality of Service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Businesses find out that can get more reliability without the high cost of delivery.&nbsp; Many applications run better as virtual machines.&nbsp; Sharepoint&#47;Exchange are mentioned all the time to VMware that it is better.</p>
<p>The latest step this year is IT as a Service (ITaaS).&nbsp; Phase 3 is all about agility.&nbsp; How can IT offer computer resources for giving the business the ability to quickly consume these resources to get to value faster is the question?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>IT as a Service == Optimizing IT production for business consumption.<&#47;strong><&#47;p><br />
Update 9:30am:</p>
<p>Some of the great innovations is that by having OS instances that aren't owning the hardware means you have options.&nbsp;&nbsp; Large change in how IT addresses computing.</p>
<p>Can start talking about the computer food groups of compute, storage, network, security and work on decreasing OpEx and enhancing security.&nbsp;&nbsp; One item that has been missing out of this has been security and is now a serious focus by VMware.</p>
<p>Now because we can separate from hardware and have defined what a datacenter is we can start abstracting away from the datacenter itself and virtualize that.</p>
<p>Realistically Hybrid Cloud is the right approach by Paul Martiz.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need management.&nbsp;&nbsp; We need standards.</p>
<p>Update 9:39am:</p>
<p>The current solutions really address the old applications and approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next true step is how can we make new applications more scalable and cloud friendly.&nbsp;&nbsp; So a new application platform needs to be defined and delivered.&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the common services they need?</p>
<p>Common Management, Common Services and Open frameworks.&nbsp; These frameworks have to be able to handle whatever programming languages are coming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time you tie to a language someone will come along with a new language that solves some problem.&nbsp; Need to stay away form that wherever we can.</p>
<p>These Frameworks also need to connect to different clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Google App Engine, vmForce, vCloud.</p>
<p>Update 9:47am:</p>
<p>Different devices are coming into the business environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; IT has no choice on this.&nbsp; It will come one way or another and IT will need to figure out how to deliver secure, manageable approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; iPads are coming in over night.</p>
<p>The third layer of innovation needed called "New End User Access".&nbsp; This is the stack that is now the new IT one for the cloud era.</p>
<p>Update 9:51am:</p>
<p>Steve Herrod's turn to show the details of the theory from Paul Maritz.</p>
<p>Again vSphere is the basis of this all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can really deliver and is getting better and faster on every release.&nbsp;&nbsp; Policy driven SLAs with Network IO control and Storage IO control.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you know about vSphere 4.1 already this part is a good review.</p>
<p>Integrien, the acquisition of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp; VMware is buying them for their proactive heatmap style management and allocation.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a new style of management to show the tons of information in easier to process displays.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very graphical.</p>
<p>Update 10:02am:</p>
<p>Herrod:&nbsp; For IT as a Service is key about moving to offering an "App Store" for clients at the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They want services, not VMs.&nbsp;&nbsp; They want a database server, web server.&nbsp; Not a Windows&#47;Linux&#47;Unix box generally.</p>
<p>Virtual Datacenters are a key way to discuss this.&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide the services you define the SLAs an function of that datacenter.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can setup just what you need and what levels are necessary.</p>
<p>vCloud Director is live.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the key management tool for this entire environment.</p>
<p>Update 10:12am:</p>
<p>vShield platform is a critical to making the Cloud work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Need a common set of services that will offer some basic security available everywhere.&nbsp; This is both on the private and the public cloud.&nbsp; vCloud Director is on both sides of the fence and offers the same functionality everywhere and can span the private to the public in a secure way.</p>
<p>Update 10:26am:</p>
<p>Now we are on the Application platform layer and is what vFabric is all about.&nbsp; It is a common set of services available to make new application cloud friendly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The great thing about this is it will work with Ruby, Python, Java etc.</p>
<p>Update 10:27am:</p>
<p>The final area is the End User Computing experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; View 4.5 is the part of modernizing the desktop direction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Released today.&nbsp;&nbsp; View 4.5 has the ability to lower the cost of acquistion below $500 a system which is below the physical desktop costs.</p>
<p>The now is to call User-centric IT.&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to get away from PC Centric.&nbsp; Most consumers are use to using any device.&nbsp; Why not move to User focused?</p>
<p>Project Horizon demo going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is focused around User-Centric IT.&nbsp;&nbsp; This allows you to have whatever applications you are licensed are immediately provisioned to your virtual workstation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Single sign on and user focused.&nbsp; Not device.&nbsp; Some applications may not work well on a given devices.</p>
<p>A good demo of View iPad client with Project Horizon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the future of IT.</p>
<p>Update: 3 Sept 2010 - Fixed the company name (Integrien) that VMware bought</p>
