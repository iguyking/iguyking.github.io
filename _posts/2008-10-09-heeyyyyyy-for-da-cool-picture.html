<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.transitive.com" target="_blank">Transitive<&#47;a> software has a lower level of virtualization that VMware and Xen and Hyper-V don't do today.&nbsp; That is virtualizing the CPU layer with a full abstraction layer, not a pass thru approach using Ring 0&#47;Ring 3 the way the x86 Ring Architecture the way it was originally intended to be used.&nbsp;&nbsp; By this I mean they create a virtualization layer that allows you to emulate the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.transitive.com&#47;customers&#47;apple" target="_blank">PowerPC CPU on x86<&#47;a> hardware or <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.transitive.com&#47;solutions&#47;legacy" target="_blank">SPARC on x86<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Well they had this really nice raffle program they did during VMworld where they gave away a MacBook every day for 3 days of the convention with their virtualization suite installed on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; They had one more MacBook they were to give away for the best picture with their shirt and glasses on.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I told my family about it and my children wanted to go and take some pictures with a hometown hero's statue.</p>
<p>We sent the pictures in and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.transitive.com&#47;2008&#47;10&#47;coolest-photo-wins-the-coolest-prize&#47;" target="_blank">ta-da..<&#47;a> A new toy coming soon.</p>
