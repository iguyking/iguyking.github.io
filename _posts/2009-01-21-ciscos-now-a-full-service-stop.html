<p>Cisco's throwing their gloves into the ring for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/technology/companies/20cisco.html?_r=1" target="_blank">server hardware</a>.   Now they can offer Server Hardware, Datacenter Experts (strong in Server Virtualization with their investments into VMware) and Networking Hardware.  All they need now is to offer some Storage Virtualization Appliance on their Server Hardware and they can start to offer the whole datacenter in a shipping container.</p>
<p>Next Up:  Commodity Datacenters.   Everything the Cloud wishes it could be.</p>
