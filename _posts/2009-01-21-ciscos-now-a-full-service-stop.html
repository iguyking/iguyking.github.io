<p>Cisco's throwing their gloves into the ring for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nytimes.com&#47;2009&#47;01&#47;20&#47;technology&#47;companies&#47;20cisco.html?_r=1" target="_blank">server hardware<&#47;a>.   Now they can offer Server Hardware, Datacenter Experts (strong in Server Virtualization with their investments into VMware) and Networking Hardware.&nbsp; All they need now is to offer some Storage Virtualization Appliance on their Server Hardware and they can start to offer the whole datacenter in a shipping container.</p>
<p>Next Up:&nbsp; Commodity Datacenters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything the Cloud wishes it could be.</p>
