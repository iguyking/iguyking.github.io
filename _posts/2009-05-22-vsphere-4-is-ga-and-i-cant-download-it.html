<p>vSphere 4 is now GA and available for download if you are evaluating it.&nbsp;&nbsp; However if you have Support &amp; Service contract for in-line free upgrade of your licenses, your out of luck (or at least this morning when I tried 3 different ways).</p>
<p>If I went in and said I wanted to evaluate it, then I could download everything just fine.</p>
<p>If I get an email saying vSphere 4 is ready for download I should be able to download it.&nbsp; Am I asking too much?</p>
