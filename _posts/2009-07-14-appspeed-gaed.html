<p>VMware <a title="VMware vCenter AppSpeed" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vmware.com&#47;products&#47;vcenter-appspeed&#47;" target="_blank">vCenter AppSpeed<&#47;a> product has just been officially released.   For some reason I'm actually really hyped about this product.   Guess its time to see if all the marketing foo really pays off and shows me a couple problem children and reasons in my environment.   I'll start testing this soon and post my results.</p>
