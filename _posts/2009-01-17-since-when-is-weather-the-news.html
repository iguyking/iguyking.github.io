<p>Here I am sitting in Wisconsin and see this ad on the standard news channel that they are going to have coverage starting at 4am.&nbsp;&nbsp; The coverage is "Weather".&nbsp; Normally they start at 5am for road coverage and some overnight news.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing exciting.</p>
<p>So what are they going to talk about at 4am when all the schools are closed already.&nbsp; All parents and kids are going to be sleeping in.&nbsp; People are going to sleep in if anything today.</p>
<p><strong>News story:<&#47;strong> It's cold.<br />
<strong>Breaking News:<&#47;strong> It's really cold.<br />
<strong>Man on the street:<&#47;strong> Dang Barbara, it's cold out here.&nbsp; I'm going to put on that hat right now.<br />
<strong>Latest News: <&#47;strong> It's really cold.&nbsp; Wear more layers and cover up so you don't freeze your nose off.<br />
<strong>Last News before you head to work:<&#47;strong> It's really cold.&nbsp; You know that hat and sweater you have and don't wear, put it on you fool.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, the news said tomorrow's going to be in the negatives.&nbsp; Dress warm.&nbsp; This closing schools is silly.</p>
<p>Since when is the weather news?</p>
