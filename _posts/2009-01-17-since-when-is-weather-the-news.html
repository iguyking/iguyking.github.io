<p>Here I am sitting in Wisconsin and see this ad on the standard news channel that they are going to have coverage starting at 4am.   The coverage is "Weather".  Normally they start at 5am for road coverage and some overnight news.   Nothing exciting.</p>
<p>So what are they going to talk about at 4am when all the schools are closed already.  All parents and kids are going to be sleeping in.  People are going to sleep in if anything today.</p>
<p><strong>News story:</strong> It's cold.<br />
<strong>Breaking News:</strong> It's really cold.<br />
<strong>Man on the street:</strong> Dang Barbara, it's cold out here.  I'm going to put on that hat right now.<br />
<strong>Latest News: </strong> It's really cold.  Wear more layers and cover up so you don't freeze your nose off.<br />
<strong>Last News before you head to work:</strong> It's really cold.  You know that hat and sweater you have and don't wear, put it on you fool.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, the news said tomorrow's going to be in the negatives.  Dress warm.  This closing schools is silly.</p>
<p>Since when is the weather news?</p>
