<p>Good friend of mine calls me and hollers on 1 Apr that his websites aren't working.  I look and find out that the DNS servers at register.com aren't responding.   After a call to Register.com they say "not our issue and is something happening to the net".</p>
<p>Guess it is <a title="DDos Attack against DNS Registrars" href="http://www.scmagazineus.com/DDoS-attacks-hit-major-web-services/article/130060/" target="_blank">their issue</a>.</p>
<p>My friend can't wait for this to end to move his stuff to a different Registrar.</p>
