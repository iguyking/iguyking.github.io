<p>Good friend of mine calls me and hollers on 1 Apr that his websites aren't working.&nbsp; I look and find out that the DNS servers at register.com aren't responding.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a call to Register.com they say "not our issue and is something happening to the net".</p>
<p>Guess it is <a title="DDos Attack against DNS Registrars" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.scmagazineus.com&#47;DDoS-attacks-hit-major-web-services&#47;article&#47;130060&#47;" target="_blank">their issue<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>My friend can't wait for this to end to move his stuff to a different Registrar.</p>
