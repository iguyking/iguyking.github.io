  content: Great find. Back in college I was writing a program to play checkers against
    a human. My professor looked at my program and saw all of these nested if statements
    and laughed at me and showed me what the correct answer was for how to write the
    program. Sure his was more advanced but mine ran 10 times faster. Just goes to
    show there's always a better mouse trap and sometimes it's as simple as a sledgehammer.

  content: Indeed.  Does this also return the same object back to the pipeline that
    a get-vm does?

  content: ! "It returns a Get-View object.   Its not the same ton of associated properties
    and objects.\n\nMy point in the post is that a significant number of scripts perform
    the same exact action and that being \"Get-VM | Get-View | etc..\"  However Get-VM
    is significantly slow if you are just going to go to Get-View immediately afterwards.
    \ \n\nIf your script goes and says \"Get-VM | Get-View\" then you should do a
    \"Get-View -ViewType VirtualMachine\".   If you have other things your going to
    do with a Get-VM then this might not be the best solution for you."

<p>I've been starting to look at using the VI Toolkit which uses Powershell.&nbsp;&nbsp; In doing this many of the command formats tend to be "<em>Get-VM | Get-View<&#47;em>" or "<em>Get-VMHost | Get-View<&#47;em>".&nbsp;&nbsp; So I'm off and figuring this out and I run a small script and say "Geez that took a long time to run".&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm talking to my co-worker (a pretty smart cookie) and he says "Why don't you just use "<em>Get-View -ViewType VirtualMachine<&#47;em>" and skip the middle man?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Good point.&nbsp; Didn't know about that command.&nbsp; Well this is just a tad bit faster.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Get-VM | Get-View <&#47;em>timing in my script takes <strong>1 minute and 37 seconds<&#47;strong>.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Get-View -ViewType VirtualMachine <&#47;em>takes an amazing <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5.12 seconds<&#47;strong><&#47;span>.<&#47;p></p>
<p>The VI Toolkit developers have identified this as a serious issue are working on ways to speed this up and retain backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>So the lesson today is if you need to do a Get-View immediately after doing some set collection look at using the <em>Get-View -ViewType <&#47;em>instead.&nbsp; It isn't as readable though it gets the job done well.</p>
