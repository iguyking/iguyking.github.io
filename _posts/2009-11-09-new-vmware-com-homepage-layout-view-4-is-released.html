<p>New <a title="VMware.com" href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank">vmware.com</a> HomePage is now live.   I had an "anonymous internet tipster" give the heads up last night.   Looks good and a bit more sleek in fitting with the branding of the new vmware logo.</p>
<p>Along with that <a title="VMware View 4 " href="http://www.vmware.com/products/view/" target="_blank">View 4</a> is finally released.   I've been playing with some beta bits for a while now and the PCoIP is pretty impressive catchup with ICA protocol.   I'm looking forward to the mass quantity of comparisons that are going to come out now between ICA & PCoIP.</p>
