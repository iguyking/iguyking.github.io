<p>New <a title="VMware.com" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vmware.com" target="_blank">vmware.com<&#47;a> HomePage is now live.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had an "anonymous internet tipster" give the heads up last night.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks good and a bit more sleek in fitting with the branding of the new vmware logo.</p>
<p>Along with that <a title="VMware View 4 " href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vmware.com&#47;products&#47;view&#47;" target="_blank">View 4<&#47;a> is finally released.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been playing with some beta bits for a while now and the PCoIP is pretty impressive catchup with ICA protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm looking forward to the mass quantity of comparisons that are going to come out now between ICA &amp; PCoIP.</p>
