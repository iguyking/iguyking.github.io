<p>The ESXi Hardening guide started in the 2.x days.&nbsp; It was originally a best practices document around security.&nbsp; In the 4.x, VMware started breaking it into categories of information.&nbsp;&nbsp; Improvements over the years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some feedback on the 4.x guide is that it was presented in PDF, limited ways on how to resolve it and mitigate the listed risk and was not usable in a programmatic format.</p>
<p>The new format in 5.0 is a spreadsheet guide with categorization by component and sub-components.&nbsp; Now this spreadsheet includes techniques to implement and apply these recommendations.&nbsp; Look at http:&#47;&#47;vmware.com&#47;go&#47;securityguides for more information.</p>
<p>Automating these solutions and suggestions is the next obvious step in addressing the security concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp; As such the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;scap.nist.gov&#47;validation&#47;index.html ">SCAP <&#47;a>standard from NIST which allows security audit and validation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Standard allows you to do checklist validation style approaches and how it is setup.&nbsp; XCCDF is the primary XML rule based system for validation around testing and assessment.&nbsp; XCCDF is the setup of the checklist approach and then OVAL designates a fixtext area which can be programmatic or just manual steps.&nbsp; Together these two things will help by having standardized approach to building and utilization of security information and validation.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;oval.mitre.org">OVAL<&#47;a> is the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language. Today there are over 13,500 definitions made that include different versions of all OS platforms.&nbsp; This is open and community driven and significant amount of information being created every day.&nbsp; This standard links with CVE to show vulnerability scoring which is more timely and updated reasonably quickly.</p>
