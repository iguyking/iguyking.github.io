<p>My wife's laptop backup hard drive is starting to die. &nbsp;Now that hard drive is only about 5 years old, firewire external drive. &nbsp;So I think we've definitely gotten our use out of it. &nbsp;Needless to say she's a little concerned about loosing some of the data on it, so I told her to copy it over to the home file server that gets automatically backed up to the cloud. &nbsp;She proceeded to start copying the data over and since this hard drive is having a rough time, the GUI copy kept failing as some of the files are corrupted now.</p>
<p>So I took the hard drive down and directly connected it to my Ubuntu system. &nbsp;My drive came up as &#47;dev&#47;sdg. &nbsp;First step is to get hfsprogs installed</p>
<pre>apt-get install hpfsprogrs<&#47;pre><br />
Once it is installed, to be safe I wanted to run fsck on the filesystem to give me the best chance possible to copy the data over. &nbsp;Next I ran</p>
<pre>fdisk -l<&#47;pre></p>
<pre>[...]<br />
Disk &#47;dev&#47;sdg doesn't contain a valid partition table<&#47;pre><br />
Now that doesn't surprise me since mac uses GPT by default and this drive is a little wonky. &nbsp;Instead I used GNU Parted</p>
<pre>parted<&#47;pre></p>
<pre>(parted) select &#47;dev&#47;sdg<br />
Using &#47;dev&#47;sdg<br />
(parted) print<br />
Model: Ext Hard Disk (scsi)<br />
Disk &#47;dev&#47;sdg: 500GB<br />
Sector size (logical&#47;physical): 512B&#47;512B<br />
Partition Table: mac<&#47;pre></p>
<pre>Number Start End Size File system Name Flags<br />
 1 512B 32.8kB 32.3kB Apple<br />
 2 32.8kB 61.4kB 28.7kB Macintosh<br />
 3 61.4kB 90.1kB 28.7kB Macintosh<br />
 4 90.1kB 119kB 28.7kB Macintosh<br />
 5 119kB 147kB 28.7kB Macintosh<br />
 6 147kB 410kB 262kB Macintosh<br />
 7 410kB 672kB 262kB Macintosh<br />
 8 672kB 934kB 262kB Patch Partition<br />
10 135MB 500GB 500GB hfs+ Untitled<&#47;pre><br />
Now I know that I'm looking to run fsck on partition 10.</p>
<pre>fsck.hfsplus -f &#47;dev&#47;sdg10<&#47;pre><br />
Once that completed successfully, I mounted it with</p>
<pre>mount -t hfsplus &#47;dev&#47;sdg &#47;media&#47;usbdrive<&#47;pre><br />
Finally a way to allow this to run a couple times and not just stop on the first failure due to Read Errors or IO errors I used</p>
<pre>rsync -avE &#47;media&#47;usbdrive &#47;media&#47;backupsystem<&#47;pre><br />
Enjoy.. HFS+ support is very good in linux from my experience now. &nbsp; This copy took about 12 hours with many retries to get what I could off of it.</p>
