<p>Recently I found that my environment of ESX 4 Classic has a lot of static NIC speed settings. This is a rather interesting discovery as I've been a strong proponent of using Auto Negotiation on all the NICs as that will help one find flaky or poorly connected cables along with a variety of other issues. If you have it force set to a speed, you won't get any notification that a given connection is working poorly until someone digs in pretty deeply.</p>
<p>Ethermind goes into very well with some <a href="http://etherealmind.com/ethernet-autonegotiation-works-why-how-standard-should-be-set/">deep research into WHY</a> you should always use AutoNegotiation at Gig or faster speeds.</p>

<p>As such found that there are many 100meg static settings. This has a tendancy to cause problems with network performance when the other side thinks it is auto-negotiating.</p>
<p>To fix this if you are properly redundant is a safe way to walk through your environment updating and giving each NIC a chance to negotiate before doing the next on each host.   </p>
