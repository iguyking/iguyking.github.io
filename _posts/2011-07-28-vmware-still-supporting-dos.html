<p>Just saw the release of the 28 July 2011 patches for ESX(i) and in the list fixed is this little nugget.</p>
<blockquote><p>When you use Altiris DOS boot disk and PXE boot a<br />
virtual machine running on ESX 4.1 with flexible<br />
adapter, the virtual machine might fail to start when it<br />
attempts to load MS‚ÄêDOS LAN Manager NetBind.</blockquote><br />
VMware is still supporting DOS long after Microsoft has sent it to the curb.  I know several Fortune 1000 companies that still have DOS applications that they need to run that are critical to the business processes.   What other top notch <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/hyperv-supported-guest-os.aspx">hypervisors </a>support DOS still?</p>
